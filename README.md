Infrastructure and code for creating full sectors for the Rogue Trader RPG.

## Inspiration
Inspired by
* [Stars of Inequity](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/109745/Rogue-Trader-Stars-of-Inequity)
* [The Koronus Beastiary](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/103980/Rogue-Trader-The-Koronus-Bestiary)
* [The Navis Primer](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/106695/Rogue-Trader-The-Navis-Primer)

## WIP
This is a Work In Progress. Below is the planned design.

* Shape Colors
    * A Green shape has been coded.
    * A White shape is planned but has not been complted.
    * A Red shape is a reference to a section that has been detialed elsewhere in the diagram.
* Shapes
    * Rectangles are `Asset`s
    * Ovals are `Detail`s
    * Diamonds are a collection of `Detail`s that have been grouped together for brevity.
* Lines
    * A blue line is a many2many relationship.
    * A red line is a foreignkey relationship.
    * A double line indicates that the shapes have the same parent.
