        description: "The forces radiating out from the inner furnace of a star
                      consist of far more than heat and illumination. The roiling
                      fires of a star are far beyond the mightiest earthly blaze,
                      and cast out through the system what some among the
                      Adeptus Mechanicus call “the Light Invisible.” According to
                      the doctrines of the Priesthood of Mars, visible light is but
                      a small part of a spectrum of different energies. The auger
                      arrays of voidships rely in large part on these forces, and are
                      often overwhelmed by an excess of input when travelling
                      close to particularly active stars. Though Rogue Traders are
                      not generally inclined to the techno-theological theories that
                      explain these matters, those who go through the harrowing
                      experience of guiding a vessel blinded by bursts of stellar
                      radiation often pay a great deal more respect and attention to
                      the counsel of their Enginseers afterwards.

                      Unlike most System Elements, Radiation Bursts do not
                      represent an actual presence within the System. Instead, they
                      exert an influence over the Solar Zone in which they are
                      present (almost invariably the Inner Cauldron). The Detection
                      bonus of any ship in the affected area is halved, as constant
                      low-grade interference degrades any readings gathered. In
                      addition, activity within an affected star can result in a surge
                      of radiation throughout the Solar Zone. Such surges tend to
                      be infrequent, spaced over periods of weeks, months, or more,
                      but can occur as often as every 1d5 days after a sufficient
                      build-up. Spotting the fluctuations that precede a radiation
                      surge requires an Ordinary (+10) Scrutiny+Detection
                      Test. Avoiding the effects requires leaving the affected Solar
                      Zone, sheltering behind a nearby Planet or Gas Giant, or by
                      temporarily insulating the ship’s augers with a Hard (–20)
                      Tech–Use Test. Any ship caught unprotected within the area
                      of effect suffers the effects of a Sensors Damaged critical result
                      from page 222 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook, and
                      additionally, cannot send or receive vox transmissions.
                      This Damage cannot be repaired until at least
                      1d5 hours after the surge, due to the lingering
                      presence of these ravaging energies.

                      A Solar Zone generated with multiple instances of
                      Radiation Bursts further degrades the efficiency of augers
                      within the affected area. The Detection bonus of affected
                      ships is reduced by 5 per additional instance of the System
                      Element after being halved."
