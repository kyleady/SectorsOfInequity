  description: "The Expanse is filled with tales of lost vessels and ancient outposts,
                and even a brief visit to the Halls of the Dead in Port Wander can
                turn up dozens of so called “authentic” maps to worlds beyond
                the maw, where some great saint or ill-fated expedition met its
                end. While most of these stories are about as trustworthy as the
                dock scum which spread them, there are always grains of truth
                in the lies, and the Expanse has its fair share of actual wrecks and
                hidden treasure. The GM can use the lure of wealth to draw the
                Explorers to remote worlds or tempt them into braving dense
                jungles or frozen caverns, all in the hope of finding a wondrous
                rewards with which to make their fame and fortune."

                are notorious for housing lost or forbidden technology, from

                of alien wildernesses. These wrecks are extraordinarily valuable
                finds, as there are usually components or parts to salvage. Crashed
                vessels can still hold valuable cargos, rare and expensive goods
                which never made it to their intended destination, but have lost
                none of their potential profit. These could include fuel or raw
                materials, rare minerals and precious metals, or finished goods in
                the form of weapons and munitions. Explorers, pirates, and even
                Rogue Traders can also be a source of crashed ships, lost when
                trying to plunder wrecks themselves. Given the size and perils of
                the Expanse, more of these treasure hunters vanish into the void

                where the ship has come to rest and whatever creatures or
                hazards might have taken up residence in the hulk, but also
                the alien nature of the ship itself. The rewards of plundering a
                xenos ship can be well worth the risks, and for a Rogue Trader
                willing to deal in such forbidden goods, it presents a chance for
                the Explorers to get their hands on exotic weapons, tech and
                artefacts which they would otherwise never come across.

                guncutter to the wreckage of an Emperor-class battleship spread
                across a continent. Smaller vessels make for good encounters
                within a larger adventure, such as the Explorers coming across the
                remains of a shuttle in the depths of an alien jungle, the skeletons
                of nearby crewmen and the remains of a broken vox telling a sorry
                tale of their last days. Explorers in dire need of shelter (such as
                from the acid rain or frozen storms of a hostile world) or supplies
                would be grateful for the discovery of such a vessel. Equally, it
                could be home to a hungry predator or an insane survivor, who
                will turn on the Explorers as they explore the wreck.

                Larger vessels are adventure settings in their own
                right, especially if they are the remains of Warp capable
                ships which once held tens of thousands of crew and were
                kilometres long. These vessels might be largely intact,
                depending on where they came to rest (such as the bottom
                of an ocean or the heart of a swamp) or may be little more
                than fragments (like the bridge of a cruiser rising out of the
                sands of a desert, hundreds of kilometres from the rest of
                the vessel). Over time, larger vessels will also become part
                of the Encounter Site in which they crashed, local flora and
                fauna making it their home, until it is possible for Explorers
                to wander into the interior of a vessel without realising they
                have left the forest, tundra, or jungle behind.

                Deciding why a ship crashed is an important part of
                figuring out what kinds of dangers and challenges the
                Explorers must overcome to reach it and loot its
                remains. There are a variety of reasons why a
                ship might find its final resting place on some
                remote world or system: it could have been damaged in battle
                and forced down from orbit, suffered a mishap in the Warp and
                struggled back to realspace only to crash, or fallen afoul of the
                myriad of celestial phenomena found within the Expanse. Solar
                storms, gravity wells, and debris fields could all have damaged
                or grounded a ship which came too close to a volatile or hostile
                world. Quite often a captain does not recognise the danger
                before it is too late, whether it is a yet-unrecorded local effect
                (like changing gravity patterns or rogue worlds) or some forgotten
                xenos perils (such as ancient defence grids or alien sentinels like
                those left behind by the Eldar, Yu’vath, or other ancient species).
                Mutinous crews and insane captains can also cause a ship
                to crash, deliberately plunging into a world’s atmosphere,
                either as an act of rebellion against their lord or as a last,
                desperate act against a seditious crew. Such vessels usually still
                bear signs of their final, dark moments: barricades and battle
                scars might remain where factions fought for control of the
                bridge, engine room, and core cogitator. Survivors from such
                wrecks often still cling to the memories of these rebellions,
                and the descendants of a centuries old crash might still war
                over the ancient wreck without knowing why."

  description: "Many worlds within the Expanse have never been able
                to support life, be they cold spheres of rocks with thin
                atmospheres or hostile stars that alternately freeze or burn
                their surfaces clean of anything down to even the smallest of
                bacteria. Others were once thriving biospheres, or even the
                centres of vast planetary empires, now turned into endless
                graveyards by some great horror or tragedy. However,
                sometimes a catastrophe can afflict a single region of a planet
                without even disrupting the other biomes of the world. Over
                centuries and millennia, deserts can crawl across a continent
                or magma can be thrust to the surface, the ash choking away
                all life that it does not scour away in the eruptions. Other
                times, a species might devour its way to extinction, greedily
                consuming all of the natural resources in an area before
                starving along with the ecosystem it has devastated. Though
                these Encounter Sites are often dust-coated wastelands
                inhospitable to humans, environmental catastrophe sometimes
                pushes rare minerals or exotic compounds to the surface.

                Of greatest interest and most potential profit are regions that
                were once alive, but have perished as a result of some great
                catastrophe or died a slow, strangling death. These can exist on
                almost any world, from once thriving industrialised worlds, to
                feral planets, or even Imperial outposts, lost to the numberless
                dangers found within the Expanse. In the same manner as a
                crashed vessel, a once-inhabited Death Zone presents a rotting
                carcass for the Explorers to pick over, with empty city streets
                and broken highways to navigate in search of wealth. These
                abandoned regions can be found on even the mightiest of hive
                worlds or forge worlds, amidst the continent-sized dumping
                grounds or in the irradiated underhives where none dare tread.

                If the region did, in fact, once support life, the GM should
                decide how it met its end, what grand catastrophe annihilated
                it, and if the danger posed by such an event still lingers to
                threaten the Explorers. The most dangerous kind of Death
                Zones is one for which there is no apparent evidence of what
                destroyed it. The Explorers might find the wasted remains
                of forests, empty cities, and abandoned orbital stations with
                no sign of people or any signs of violence. This could be the
                work of the Warp, the dark powers of Chaos scouring a world
                of life in a single night of horror, and leaving little evidence
                of its passing, or it could be the actions of xenos, interested
                only in the living for their own obscure reasons. In both cases,
                it is possible that the arrival of the Explorers might reawaken
                such powers, stirred to action by the presence of life and fresh
                souls for their dark masters."

  description: "Among dead worlds and lost planets are the remains of
                countless outposts and civilisations, testaments to the entropic
                nature of the universe that wipes away nearly all traces of even
                the greatest empires. Some of these lost cities are ruins, like
                those found on worlds touched by catastrophe, while others are
                remote outposts, the remains of much larger galactic kingdoms
                and races, long since cut off from their distant home worlds.
                Something nearly all lost cities have in common is their isolation
                from the rest of the Expanse, being located in places where, for
                one reason or another, they have prospered alone without the
                support of other worlds. In many cases, the inhabitants of a
                lost city will be unaware of the galaxy beyond their sky, seeing
                only empty darkness and cold stars, without any thought to the
                spectre of the Imperium that lays claim to them.

                A lost city could have once been the heart of a powerful
                planetary or even interplanetary realm, its inhabitants unaware
                of the glories of their ancestors or of the inheritance they have
                lost. This can happen if a space-faring empire falls prey to some
                great disaster, like alien invasion or celestial catastrophe. Warp
                storms can cut off a world from its neighbours and trigger such
                a decline, leading to centuries of isolation and that reduce a once
                thriving world to ruins prowled by primitive gangs, living off
                the scraps and rubbish of their ancestors. Unlike a dead world,
                lost cities usually still hold some degree of life, rather than being
                scoured clean by tragedy. They are places where beasts or the
                descendants of man cling to a world they no longer recognise,
                locked into a grim downward spiral of devolution.

                Lost cities can also be the result of deliberate human or alien
                intervention, such as in the case of a greater empire keeping a
                lesser one subservient to its desires. Among the heretic human
                empires of the Expanse, it has been documented that some
                human worlds are kept in a permanent primitive state after
                being subdued by a greater force, stripped of their technology
                and kept alive only as a source of labour or conscript soldiers
                in a vile parody of the Imperium’s own system of planetary
                tithes. It is suspected that alien races like the Dark Eldar also
                “farm” such primitive worlds for slaves, descending from the
                sky to take humans when they require new stock, and creating
                a world living in terror of their dark sky gods. The Yu’vath
                were another race to indulge in this practise of reducing a
                conquered race to a primitive tribal state, and then exploiting
                its human population for their own dark ends.

                The most interesting lost cities a Rogue Trader can visit,
                far more profitable than mere ruins or the debased remains of
                human and alien civilisations, are those that choose to remain
                lost for a reason. Among the Halo Stars are worlds and cities
                whose inhabitants have chosen to live apart from the galaxy,
                isolating themselves not because of the whims of the Warp or
                the intervention of alien races, but by conscious choice."

  description: "Humans are not alone in cultivating planets for their own needs.
                Even primitive alien species raise up cities or tunnel out warrens
                for their growing kind. These artificial domains can be maddening
                places for a human, the xenos architecture and incomprehensible
                design both taking their toll. Such places are also built for the needs
                of alien biology and ecosystems where the air, ground, and plant
                life might all be toxic or hostile to human intrusion. This could be
                because the alien settlement exists in a remote and
                dangerous location, like the depths of a chemical
                ocean or high in the willowy fronds of a microgravity
                forest. Alternatively, the xenos
                themselves might create a
                substance in the creation of
                their city; toxic secretions and
                solid excreta that are used as
                building materials.

                Alien hives come in a number of forms, primarily those
                created by sentient minds and those created by insect or
                animal instincts. The latter are obviously more common,
                and many worlds show the presence of creatures which have
                reshaped their environment to their own needs. On a small
                scale, this can mean mounds of vegetation or unnatural caves
                where a beast or creature has made its home, a place where the
                Explorers themselves seek shelter from the perils of a world
                or, if they are in search of food or trophies, track down the
                creature itself. On a larger scale, a colony of creatures could
                create an entire warren of tunnels, level a whole section of
                jungle for their nests, or even drain a swamp to create a vast,
                muddy sinkhole for a home. These larger nests can become
                quite a challenge for Explorers, as they can span kilometres
                both above and below ground, and hide unexpected treasures
                as well as more unpredictable dangers.

                Hives created by sentient creatures are an altogether more
                daunting prospect for the Explorer, as they demonstrate some
                of the intelligence mankind puts into his own cities and
                colonies. In a nest crafted by thinking minds, there is an alien
                reasoning behind its design, and often it includes defences
                and traps to confound or repel invaders. For Explorers,
                discerning the difference between a hive or warren created
                by a thinking mind and the instinctive burrowing of a xenos
                beast can a challenge, and the truth might only become
                apparent once they have ventured deep into its interior.
                Sealing portals, mechanical devices and traps, as well as a
                coordinated defensive response can all indicate
                the presence of
                something more
                than mere feral
                instinct behind
                the creation of a
                such a hive."

  description: "Humanity is far from the most dangerous creature in the galaxy,
                though it might like to believe in its own superiority. It is also is
                not the only species to dominate its environment so thoroughly
                that the terrain becomes a reflection of its own nature. Many
                alien creatures present little danger to a traveller, be they
                innocuous insects, plants, or small animals, which are no match
                for a cunning mind and a ready boltgun. Unfortunately for the
                Explorer, hidden among the xenos jungles, forests, and oceans
                of an alien world there lurk real dangers, things which can spell
                death for a traveller should he cross their path. In some cases,
                these things are obvious and terrifying; towering carnivorous
                plants, or hulking sea-beasts which are all fangs, claws and
                tentacles, clearly a foe to be wary of. However, in other cases,
                the dangers of indigenous xenoforms are much harder to detect:
                sometimes, the entire environment moves to the beat of a single
                heart, or shifts to the thoughts of a single intelligence.

                The environment itself can be a predator, and threaten
                the Explorers as soon as they set foot on a world. Continent
                spanning jungles (sharing a single root system and single mind),
                sentient oceans, and living storms are all possible, hiding from
                the Explorers in plain sight and often revealing their true
                danger only when it is too late. Beyond those xenoforms
                which the Explorers can see and destroy with a wellplaced
                bolt-shell are the multitudes of invisible
                predators a world can be host to; alien viruses
                and xenos pathogens, potentially expelled by plants, living in
                the local wildlife, or simply part of the world’s atmosphere.
                These insidious threats can infect an Explorer’s crew, either
                tearing through its ranks like a plague or lurking dormant for
                weeks or months before making its presence known, long after
                the Rogue Trader has left the world behind.

                Xenoform Biomes can also be found on settled worlds, where
                the presence of mankind (or another alien race) is seemingly well
                established. When the Imperium settles a world, it will often purge
                much of the local wildlife if it is not immediately useful or poses a
                threat to humans. Such purges are often incomplete, however, and
                a virus that controls an entire ecosystem, or a cavern complex that
                is in fact a great beast, might never be noticed."

                bloodthirsty predators at bay. While each offers a different

                potable water, edible flora (and sometimes fauna), and an

  description: "These dense regions of intense foliage are common on many
                planets, and usually indicate areas where plentiful water, rich
                soil, and abundant sunlight combine to create ideal growing
                conditions. This also often means there are many creatures
                ready to feed on the plants and many predators ready to feed
                on the plant-eaters. This cycle can become intense, with each
                organism striving to stay alive and developing even more
                powerful defensive and offensive weaponry to aid in the
                struggle. Even the plants develop their own methods to deter
                and hunt other organisms, and can become as dangerous as
                the animals dwelling within the jungle’s violent depths.

                Explorers travelling though such areas, often on hunting
                expeditions or as a result of vehicular failure, can quickly find
                themselves prey to the multitudes of life forms that surround
                them on all sides. While not as intense as a proper Death
                World setting, travellers can easily find themselves under
                attack, should they not sufficiently prepare themselves."

  description: "The one constant of the galaxy is endless war, and there
                are few planets that do not have at least one region where
                desperate armies once clashed over searing hatreds and
                vicious betrayals long since forgotten. Massive craters pit
                these areas, some so large that multiple other craters line their
                interior. Bodies, weapons, tanks, and other instruments of
                war are also plentiful, half-buried under shifting sands and
                creeping foliage. Some might have been crucial conflicts that
                turned the tide in a war, others only minor skirmishes that
                only mattered to the dead, but by now, all are so ancient that
                even the records of their details have turned to dust.

                The sheer violence that marked some battles still mars the
                area, though, leaving a more permanent record visible from orbit.
                Where unspeakable weapons devastated enemy emplacements,
                molten and irradiated metal has fused into the native rock to form
                bubbling masses of liquid sludge. Titanic war machines, many
                larger than cities, lie in ruins where they fell against engines even
                more powerful than they. Not all is quiet, however, as for some,
                the war never ended. They lie in wait, still prepared to repulse the
                next attackers, or simply anyone venturing into their line of fire."
