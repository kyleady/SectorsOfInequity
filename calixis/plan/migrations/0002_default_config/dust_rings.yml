        description: "A wide ring of fine particles encircles the gas giant. While the
                      limited spread prevents it from becoming a navigational hazard
                      like a true dust cloud or nebula, any Tests using the ship’s
                      auger arrays on a target within, on, or directly through the
                      ring are two steps more difficult. Multiple instances of this
                      Orbital Feature increase the size of the existing Planetary
                      Rings instead of adding extra sets of Rings. Increase the
                      penalty to use augers through or within the Rings by an
                      additional –5 for every two additional instances of this
