        name: Forest
        description: "A Forest is primarily defined by an abundance of large-
                      scale flora, although they are commonly home to a great
                      many additional species. Tropical forests and jungles, in
                      particular, are known for this kind of diversity. While a
                      number of populations within the Imperium would consider
                      the presence of trees an absolute necessity for a forest,
                      this attitude stems primarily from terraforming and
                      colonisation efforts from the Dark Age of Technology and
                      the ancient times that preceded it. Planets that develop
                      on their own often have forests of tangled vines, enormous
                      mushrooms, fungal mounds, and even stranger things."

                      they are not individually as large as Mountain Landmarks, the
                      individual elements of a mountain range are nonetheless quite
                      impressive, in most cases. Sometimes a range is found that
                      trades frost-capped peaks for volcanic fissures, making for a
                      Territory more perilous than most.

                      Mountain Ranges grant Explorers who can see them a +10
                      bonus to Navigate (Surface) Tests when they can be used as a

                      few tenacious weeds. Variations in the soil, climate, and other
