        name: Forest
        description: "A Forest is primarily defined by an abundance of large-
                      scale flora, although they are commonly home to a great
                      many additional species. Tropical forests and jungles, in
                      particular, are known for this kind of diversity. While a
                      number of populations within the Imperium would consider
                      the presence of trees an absolute necessity for a forest,
                      this attitude stems primarily from terraforming and
                      colonisation efforts from the Dark Age of Technology and
                      the ancient times that preceded it. Planets that develop
                      on their own often have forests of tangled vines, enormous
                      mushrooms, fungal mounds, and even stranger things."

        description: "The serried peaks of a Mountain Range are a presence as
                      impressive in their sum as any single towering peak. Though
                      they are not individually as large as Mountain Landmarks, the
                      individual elements of a mountain range are nonetheless quite
                      impressive, in most cases. Sometimes a range is found that
                      trades frost-capped peaks for volcanic fissures, making for a
                      Territory more perilous than most.

                      Mountain Ranges grant Explorers who can see them a +10
                      bonus to Navigate (Surface) Tests when they can be used as a
                      point of reference, in the same manner as Landmarks."

        description: "The broad category of Plains applies to grasslands, savannahs,
                      scrublands, and stony plateaus, among stranger things. All such
                      Territories consist of an uninterrupted expanse of flattened
                      ground, but they have little else in common. Many are verdant
                      with native grasses and shrubs, while others harbour only a
                      few tenacious weeds. Variations in the soil, climate, and other
                      conditions can allow for anything from a barren expanse of
                      baked clay, to a lush grazing ground for the local fauna."

        description: "In a galaxy where there might not be enough water to fill a
                      Grox trough in a whole system, the presence of marshes and
                      wetlands sometimes seems incredible. However, an abundance
                      of water can be nearly as deadly as its lack, with such areas
                      being a breeding ground for all manner of diseases and
                      toxins. A number of the more infamous worlds of the Calixis
                      Sector, including the death world of Woe, owe much of their
                      reputations to heavy coverage in swampland."

        description: "A Wasteland can be a frozen tundra or a scorching ocean of
                      sand dunes, or many other things in between. In all cases,
                      these lands are defined by being inimical to life. They
                      are not merely full of danger, as a Swamp or predatorhaunted
                      Forest might be, but are dangers in themselves.
                      Not even the native flora or fauna can easily live in a
                      Wasteland, where water is scarce and the very air can be cruel.
                      Wastelands are frequently found in regions of extreme heat
                      or cold. At the GMâ€™s discretion, a Wasteland can have an
                      additional instance of the Extreme Temperature Territory
                      Trait, in addition to whatever it generates randomly."
