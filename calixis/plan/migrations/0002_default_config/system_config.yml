          with such resources as passing meteors and comets became

          be tapped in the name of profit. Habitable worlds within such
          an area are highly prized as possible colony sites, although

  description: "In most systems, the pull of gravity is a constant and unchangeable
          fact of the universe, surer than the light of the stars in the sky.
          However, in some regions of space, the cataclysmic turmoil of
          certain fundamental forces causes gravitational fields to churn
          like a storm-wracked sea. Fierce gravity riptides have been
          known to tear apart the hulls of voidships too incautious to
          head the warnings of their augers, and some of the worst such
          anomalies become bleak legends among experienced helmsmen.
          Tales of the Invisible Reef and the Mouth of the Void are a staple
          of gossiping voidsmen in Port Wander. Some tides of gravity
          are gentler, and can be a boon to crews desperate for planetfall,
          swiftly bearing vessels along hidden currents in space. These
          streams are resources as treasured as the riptides are feared."

  description: "If the tales of a typical voidship crew on shore leave were
          to be believed, it might be surmised that all unexplored
          territory in the galaxy fell into two simple categories. Of
          the nightmarish systems that suffer no intrusion, the tales
          are often closer to the mark than their tellers might realise.
          Though the undisturbed rings of idyllic paradise worlds
          orbiting soothingly stars tend to exist only in the tales of
          drunken voidsmen, the persistence of such hopes cannot be
          entirely attributed to optimism. After all, Particularly fortunate
          vessels sometimes pull into systems so brimming with
          habitable worlds as to defy conventional understanding.
          The crews which make such finds are not always as fortunate
          as they imagine, as the inhabitants of such worlds often take
          a dim view of the idea that their home belongs to a complete
          stranger by right of divine providence, and frequently have
          enough resources to make their displeasure known. Even
          finding such a voidfarer’s paradise in pristine condition can
          cause trouble, if word gets out to rival interests. The rarity
          of such finds makes theft or conquest an easier method of
          acquisition than discovery. Those captains who do manage to
          claim, hold, and exploit their find inevitably find their names
          working into the growing legends of the Expanse."

          regions are simply cursed. Places truly bearing the mark of a
          curse are exceedingly rare. Still, for every such unfathomable
          anomaly, there are hundreds of clusters hanging under a
          shroud of legend and circumstance just as capable of ruining
          the fortunes of an unprepared Rogue Trader.
          Some of the most famous parts of the Expanse are
          little better understood than the eternal gloom of the Far
          Corpse Stars. For generations, they have been the subject
          of dread rumour sparked by the smallest scrap of charnel
          truth. Whole crews have mutinied upon hearing they were
          to embark for the Noctis Cluster, the Crimson Labyrinth, or
          the Silver Vaults. Despite all this, there are still many who
          are mad enough to brave the light of these stars in hope of
          vast treasures, or to drown out their baleful influence with
          the Emperor’s light. Some such efforts have been launched
          simply by the ego of a successful captain, who could not
          tolerate the idea that such a place was barred to him.
          Apply the following to Systems with this System Feature:

          • Any ship entering the System for the first time loses 1d5
          Morale, unless one of the Explorers passes a Challenging
          (+0) Charm or Intimidate Test. If the nature and
          reputation of the System was known to the crew ahead
          of time, the Test difficulty and Morale loss for failure
          might be higher at the GM’s discretion.

          • All Morale loss suffered within this System is increased
          by 1, as the crew attribute whatever misfortune they
          suffer to the malevolent will of their surroundings. This
          does not apply to Morale lost for entering a System the
          first time (even the most fearful voidsman’s imagination
          can only concoct so many horrors!).

          • Any Fear Tests made within the System are made at an
          additional –10 penalty."

  description: "Not all of the Expanse’s lost treasures are entombed behind
            long abandoned walls, or hidden behind a pall of ancient
            doom. Throughout a number of systems, thriving cultures
            expand beyond their native worlds and take to the stars,
            to claim resources rightfully belonging to the Imperium of
            Man. When such nascent empires belong to humanity, it is
            the duty of any Rogue Trader who encounters them to teach
            them the word and will of the Emperor. Those belonging
            to a xenos race are supposed to be stamped out before they
            can become a serious threat, although some Rogue Traders
            prefer to pass off that responsibility to any others they can
            find, and seek a more profitable venture.

            • If the System contains less than four Planets after all System
            Elements have been generated, the GM should add additional
            Planets until the Region contains at least four Planets.

            • A common civilisation is spread across 1d5+3 System
            Features in this System. This might be either a non-
            Imperial human nation or a race of previously unknown,
            sentient xenos. During the Planet Creation process for
            this System, all Planets with a native civilisation are
            automatically inhabited by the appropriate species at
            a Development level of Voidfarers, Colony, or Orbital
            Habitation, as appropriate. At least one Planet has a native
            population at the Voidfarers Development level. Any
            Habitable Planet not populated by the Starfarers generates
            Inhabitants normally. If there are not enough Planets in the
            System for each Starfarer colony to have its own Planet,
            multiple habitations can be placed on the same planets, or
            on Asteroids, in Starship Graveyards, or in other System
            Features as the Game Master sees fit."

  description: "Among the Imperial citizens privileged with the opportunity
          to consider matters beyond their own world, most are aware
          of some basic tenets about the way the void is made up. It
          is known to these erudite few that all planets orbit a star
          which is the centre of a vast system of other bodies, and that
          these systems are part of a larger galaxy, which is part of
          the manifest destiny of all Mankind. They know these simple
          truths because noble and trustworthy officials of the Imperium
          have told them so, well aware that spreading knowledge of
          the full complexity of reality would only cause trouble.
          Many star systems throughout the galaxy are
          themselves in orbit of a variety of bizarre phenomena,
          with little in common other than their incredible mass
          and gravity. Some orbital objects have long been familiar
          to Mankind, such as black holes and other artefacts of
          the life and death of stars. Others are known only by
          obscure classifications from the Dark Age of Technology,
          and many exist completely outside human understanding.
          Many of the most well-known and well-defined sub-
          Sectors and star clusters are centred around a noteworthy
          celestial object. These objects frequently serve the same
          purpose on astromantic charts and the secret rutters
          of the Navigator Houses as terrestrial landmarks
          might serve on a surface map.

          • Reduce the number of Planets generated by 2, as the
          presence of a Stellar Anomaly tends to disrupt the
          formation of any bodies smaller than itself.

          • Scholastic Lore (Astromancy) and Navigation (Stellar)
          Tests made to plot routes through the System, or to
          determine position within it, receive a +10 bonus.

          • The massive forces exerted by a Stellar Anomaly
          sometimes seems to stabilise local Warp routes, though
          many dismiss this as voidsmen’s superstition and no
          record exists of any Navigator’s comment on the matter.
          Ships travelling through the System only need to roll
          for Warp Travel Encounters for every seven full days of
          travel (or once, for a trip of under seven days). However,
          the same forces make the necessity of occasional drops
          into realspace for course adjustment into an additional
          hazard. On any result of doubles when rolling for a
          Warp Travel encounter, the vessel runs afoul of a hazard
          in realspace instead of applying the normally generated
          result. The effects of such hazards can be extrapolated
          from similar System Elements, such as Gravity Riptides,
          Radiation Bursts, or Solar Flares."

  description: "Many a Navigator has breathed a sigh of relief after braving and
          besting the Maw, only to choke on it as the roiling currents of
          the Expanse proper come into view. The untamed tides beyond
          the great Warp storms are less forgiving than many of the wellcharted
          routes of the Imperium, and among them are many
          shoals and reefs ready to rend asunder the intruding reality of
          any passing voidship. Unfortunately, a number of choice and
          valuable worlds lie within the boundaries of these hazards, and
          more than one Rogue Trader has lost his ship and his life seeking
          to claim them. These cautionary tales do little to warn away
          those emboldened by the rare example of legendary captains
          who have wrested riches out of the grasp of the Warp.

          Tests for Warp Jumps that begin or end in this System."
