        description: "The galaxy has no shortage of planets rich in valuable minerals,
                      as such materials are often among the very building blocks of
                      a world’s existence. Technically speaking, such resources are
                      present and abundant on every world, but few worlds in the
                      Imperium have a need to import shale or low-grade tin, much less
                      have enough of a market for it to merit the attention of a Rogue
                      Trader dynasty. True mineral wealth exists in materials either too
                      rare to be commonly found, or too important for a surplus to
                      be accumulated. The most valuable deposits are those with both
                      utility and rarity, and worlds where they can be obtained have
                      been the cause of countless conflicts between rival dynasties."

        description: "Among the materials most highly valued throughout the
                      Imperium are a number of commonly occurring metals, such as
                      iron, copper, or lead. Of particular note is iron, supplies of which
                      manage to be both abundant and insufficient to demand in nearly
                      every sector’s tradehouses. The reason for this paradoxical value
                      can be found in the ever-grinding gears of the Imperial war
                      machine, which requires a vast supply of these metals for the
                      billions of weapons and vehicles it produces every day.

                      This insatiable need for raw materials has launched many
                      newly founded dynasties to prominence, and even the most
                      arrogant patriarch knows better than to scorn the profits brought
                      by such efforts. Although a hold full of industrial metals is
                      welcome in almost any port, canny Rogue Traders prefer to
                      establish supply contracts with agencies such as the Departmento
                      Munitorum, or with powerful forge worlds and shipyards. In
                      addition to keeping profits stable, such ties can be leveraged for
                      forms of support that could not otherwise be bought."

                      their impressive beauty and lustre, or even simply for being
                      difficult to acquire. While manufactorums occasionally have
                      uses for such materials, the most common market for precious
                      metals, gemstones, and other ornamental minerals has always
                      been the Imperium’s nobility. The rarity and expense of gold,
                      crux-gems, and other ornamentals is used to make a statement
                      about the power and reach of their bearer. Such statements
                      have also been turned to nobler purposes than vanity by some
                      cardinals in the Ecclesiarchy, who seek to exalt the majesty of
                      the Him on Earth in fine marble temples, with gilded altars
                      and stained glass windows cut from the finest crystal.

                      Though only the least valuable and sought-after minerals of this
                      sort can be found with any regularity, the sheer variety of known
                      precious and semi-precious metals and stones makes prospecting
                      for something of this sort a simple task. Finding buyers with the
                      wealth and interest to make a given cargo worthwhile, however,
                      can sometimes be a more challenging task than acquiring it."

        description: "Demand for radioactive materials can be extremely limited, as
                      most technologies making use of their properties became obsolete
                      well before the Great Crusade. Infrastructure in the Imperium
                      being what it is, Rogue Traders can and do find worlds that
                      have not progressed beyond primitive nuclear furnaces, but such
                      societies are rarely able to offer the necessary compensation for
                      supplies. Instead, trade in radioactives is done almost exclusively
                      with obscure branches of the Adeptus Mechanicus, known for
                      particularly arcane or esoteric practices.

                      Given the sensitive nature of the Machine God’s mysteries,
                      locating such groups can be extremely difficult, and those
                      Rogue Traders who manage it very rarely have any idea of the
                      purposes to which their cargos are put. Given the incredible
                      prices a Magos might be willing to pay for a regular (but
                      discreet) supply run of even the most limited cargos, few
                      are inclined to ask. Those who do push the issue are usually
                      threatened with termination of the supply contract, or even
                      excommunication from the Omnissiah’s favour, but more
                      subtle negotiations are the rarely discussed source for the
                      majority of newly produced atomics."

                      Some such materials would be considered staples of Imperial
                      manufacturing but for their rarity. These include the hyperdense
                      ore from which adamantium is derived, or certain
                      elements used in the production and refinement of highgrade
                      ceramite and promethium. Others are little more than
                      the most extreme examples of ornamental materials, such
                      as a gem or crystal unique to the caverns of a single world.
                      Additionally, a wide variety of substances that simply defy
                      classification can be found throughout the Expanse, from
                      the cool, liquid gold recovered from pools on a world in the
                      Accursed Demense, to semi-material shimmercrystals, which
                      can only be touched by living flesh.

                      Whether a decadent curiosity, arcane mystery, or vital
                      resource, Exotic Material deposits are exceptionally precious
                      Resources. GMs should consider allowing an Exotic Material
                      Resource to be used as if it possessed an additional degree of
                      Abundance, especially if the Explorers are able to think
                      of a particularly ambitious use for the deposit."
