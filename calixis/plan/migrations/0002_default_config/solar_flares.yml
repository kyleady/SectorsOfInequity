        description: "Though a star provides light and structure to the surrounding
                      system, it is a power best appreciated at a great distance. Seeking
                      the treasures of the Inner Cauldron can make a cautious captain
                      rich, but it can utterly destroy the greedy and reckless. Many stars
                      seethe with volatile energies that erupt forth with little notice,
                      and consume whatever is caught in their cataclysmic path.

                      Unlike most System Elements, Solar Flares do not represent an
                      actual presence within the System. Instead, they exert an influence
                      over the Solar Zone in which they are present (almost invariably
                      the Inner Cauldron). Each day a ship remains in this area, roll
                      1d10; on a result of 10 or higher, the ship is caught in the effects
                      of a Solar Flare, unless it can find shelter in a safe orbit behind
                      a sheltering object. Treat the effects of a Solar Flare as inflicting
                      1d5 hits from a Macrobattery with a Damage of 1d10+3. This
                      Damage is stopped by Void Shields. Further, the effects of the flare
                      are spread across such a vast area that it does not inflict Critical
                      Hits like a weapon with a Crit Rating. Damage past the Armour
                      of a Crippled ship still inflicts Critical Hits normally.

                      A Solar Zone generated with multiple instances of Solar
                      Flares is plagued with more frequent and widespread outbursts.
                      For each instance of this System Element, add +1 to the 1d10
                      roll for determining if there is a Solar Flare that day."
