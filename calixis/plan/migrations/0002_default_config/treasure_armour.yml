        description: "This treasure answers the silent call of the universe to expend
                      without replenishing, to rust away. No matter how hard the
                      owner of this treasure works, it never seems to stay clean.

                      Armour: This armour is covered in an unusual patina of
                      dust, slime, or other corrosive material. While this has
                      no effect on its wearer, weapons that touch it begin to
                      degrade rapidly. Whenever a melee weapon strikes this
                      armour, that weapon’s Damage is reduced by 1 until
                      it can be repaired."

        description: "Seemingly possessed of a treacherous nature, this treasure is
                      created in a counter-intuitive and misleading way that causes
                      those who look upon it to draw false conclusions, often to
                      their own terrible detriment. Whether this trickery is based
                      in illusion, strange construction, or something else varies
                      based on the item, but it is always capricious and spiteful.

                      Armour: This armour conceals a deadly threat, in the
                      form of poisoned blades fiendishly disguised in the wrists,
                      legguards, or some other suitable location. It can always be
                      used to make a Melee Attack with the following profile:
                      (Melee; 1d10+4 R; Pen 4; Toxic). Further, thanks to its
                      disarming nature, this armour grants its wearer a +5 bonus
                      on Deceive Tests."
