  description: "It is said that the Imperium is comprised of a million different
                worlds, across the galaxy. Though the precise number rises
                and falls with each righteous crusade launched, or warzone
                lost to the enemy, it is incontestable that the reach of Mankind
                spans the galaxy across untold dominions, united under the
                rule of the God-Emperor. There are some who would take
                this to mean that the ambitions of Rogue Traders are folly,
                for claiming lasting glory across such a wide dominion is
                impossible for a mortal man. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these
                melancholy types are rarely granted the rights of the Warrant
                of Trade, for such power belongs in the hands of those who see
                more clearly. Rogue Traders who understand the true nature of
                power rejoice with each new world they bring into the God-
                Emperor’s dominion, be it ever so small and benighted—for
                to raise the banner of empire over a million worlds, it is first
                necessary to raise that banner across each and every one.
                Planets are generated with the aid of the Planet Creation
                step of the World Generator, on page 19."
