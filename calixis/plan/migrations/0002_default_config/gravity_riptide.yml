        description: "The signs that warn of these destructive vortices can be nearly
                      impossible to spot until a voidship is nearly upon them,
                      the augers registering the anomaly barely soon enough to
                      scream a klaxon of warning. The customary sweep of a newly
                      discovered system seldom, if ever, turns up these hazards from
                      the distance at which it is made. More often, they remain
                      undetected and unknown until a shipâ€™s path crosses their
                      influence. The fear of these unseen hazards plagues many
                      veteran voidsmen, and any attempt to make use of a system in
                      which they are present inevitably involves mapping them on
                      the charts and rutters of the exploring fleet.
