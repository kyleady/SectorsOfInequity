  description: "A full-bodied and cohesive Asteroid Cluster is usually formed
                from the remains of a planet or moon that has undergone some
                incredible cataclysm. The pieces are held together by what is left
                of the planetoid’s gravitational field, although spread out over a
                rather larger area of space. Pirates frequently use the obscuring
                screen of an Asteroid Cluster to their advantage, and valuable
                salvage can occasionally be found drifting amongst the rocks.
                Wise captains are aware that such salvage is usually derived from
                those same pirates, or from others who did not respect the dangers
                of an asteroid field, and attempt retrieval accordingly.
                Navigating an Asteroid Cluster follows the rules for Asteroid
                Fields on pages 226–227 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook.
                Smaller fields of asteroids are often formed by the collision of
                large bodies, or the degraded wreckage of truly ancient vessels,
                but these pockets are not considered System Elements. Asteroid
                Clusters generate 1d5 Mineral Resources (see page 27)."

  description: "Some systems are wrapped in a vast ring of debris, formed
                from shattered or stillborn planets. Whatever bonds once held
                the circling fragments together have since yielded to outside
                forces, but the inescapable draw of the local star maintains the
                remaining cohesion. The encircling line of an Asteroid Belt
                can cause difficulties to ships seeking passage deeper into the
                system. Any direct route requires successful navigation of the
                ring, although it is possible to bypass an Asteroid Belt by
                leaving the orbital plane of the system. Such detours tend to
                be lengthy, often adding several full days of travel.
                Navigating an Asteroid Belt follows the rules for Asteroid
                Fields on pages 226–227 of the ROGUE TRADER Core
                Rulebook, although its diffusion across the System means
                that successfully passing through requires only an Easy (+20)
                Pilot (Space Craft)+Manoeuvrability Test. Asteroid Belts
                generate 1d5 Mineral Resources (see page 27)."

  description: "Clouds of gas, cosmic debris, and other minutiae drift through
                many systems. They originate in a variety of ways— some are
                the remains of an asteroid field, long since battered into the
                finest particles, and others contain the dissipating fury of an
                erupting solar flare, dwindling to near oblivion before being
                replenished by the next burst of plasma. These differences are
                rarely considered in depth by Rogue Traders, who have no
                use for them, except perhaps as concealment for their vessel.
                Dust Clouds follow the rules for Nebulae on page 227
                of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook. Smaller dust clouds
                often form on a temporary basis, but these are not considered
                proper System Elements as generated by this System."

                the augers registering the anomaly barely soon enough to
                scream a klaxon of warning. The customary sweep of a newly
                discovered system seldom, if ever, turns up these hazards from
                the distance at which it is made. More often, they remain
                undetected and unknown until a ship’s path crosses their
                influence. The fear of these unseen hazards plagues many
                veteran voidsmen, and any attempt to make use of a system in
                which they are present inevitably involves mapping them on
                the charts and rutters of the exploring fleet.

                consist of far more than heat and illumination. The roiling
                fires of a star are far beyond the mightiest earthly blaze,
                and cast out through the system what some among the
                Adeptus Mechanicus call “the Light Invisible.” According to
                the doctrines of the Priesthood of Mars, visible light is but
                a small part of a spectrum of different energies. The auger
                arrays of voidships rely in large part on these forces, and are
                often overwhelmed by an excess of input when travelling
                close to particularly active stars. Though Rogue Traders are
                not generally inclined to the techno-theological theories that
                explain these matters, those who go through the harrowing
                experience of guiding a vessel blinded by bursts of stellar
                radiation often pay a great deal more respect and attention to
                the counsel of their Enginseers afterwards.

                Unlike most System Elements, Radiation Bursts do not
                represent an actual presence within the System. Instead, they
                exert an influence over the Solar Zone in which they are
                present (almost invariably the Inner Cauldron). The Detection
                bonus of any ship in the affected area is halved, as constant
                low-grade interference degrades any readings gathered. In
                addition, activity within an affected star can result in a surge
                of radiation throughout the Solar Zone. Such surges tend to
                be infrequent, spaced over periods of weeks, months, or more,
                but can occur as often as every 1d5 days after a sufficient
                build-up. Spotting the fluctuations that precede a radiation
                surge requires an Ordinary (+10) Scrutiny+Detection
                Test. Avoiding the effects requires leaving the affected Solar
                Zone, sheltering behind a nearby Planet or Gas Giant, or by
                temporarily insulating the ship’s augers with a Hard (–20)
                Tech–Use Test. Any ship caught unprotected within the area
                of effect suffers the effects of a Sensors Damaged critical result
                from page 222 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook, and
                additionally, cannot send or receive vox transmissions.
                This Damage cannot be repaired until at least
                1d5 hours after the surge, due to the lingering
                presence of these ravaging energies.

                A Solar Zone generated with multiple instances of
                Radiation Bursts further degrades the efficiency of augers
                within the affected area. The Detection bonus of affected
                ships is reduced by 5 per additional instance of the System
                Element after being halved."

  description: "Though a star provides light and structure to the surrounding
                system, it is a power best appreciated at a great distance. Seeking
                the treasures of the Inner Cauldron can make a cautious captain
                rich, but it can utterly destroy the greedy and reckless. Many stars
                seethe with volatile energies that erupt forth with little notice,
                and consume whatever is caught in their cataclysmic path.

                Unlike most System Elements, Solar Flares do not represent an
                actual presence within the System. Instead, they exert an influence
                over the Solar Zone in which they are present (almost invariably
                the Inner Cauldron). Each day a ship remains in this area, roll
                1d10; on a result of 10 or higher, the ship is caught in the effects
                of a Solar Flare, unless it can find shelter in a safe orbit behind
                a sheltering object. Treat the effects of a Solar Flare as inflicting
                1d5 hits from a Macrobattery with a Damage of 1d10+3. This
                Damage is stopped by Void Shields. Further, the effects of the flare
                are spread across such a vast area that it does not inflict Critical
                Hits like a weapon with a Crit Rating. Damage past the Armour
                of a Crippled ship still inflicts Critical Hits normally.

                A Solar Zone generated with multiple instances of Solar
                Flares is plagued with more frequent and widespread outbursts.
                For each instance of this System Element, add +1 to the 1d10
                roll for determining if there is a Solar Flare that day."
