  description: "A full-bodied and cohesive Asteroid Cluster is usually formed
                from the remains of a planet or moon that has undergone some
                incredible cataclysm. The pieces are held together by what is left
                of the planetoid’s gravitational field, although spread out over a
                rather larger area of space. Pirates frequently use the obscuring
                screen of an Asteroid Cluster to their advantage, and valuable
                salvage can occasionally be found drifting amongst the rocks.
                Wise captains are aware that such salvage is usually derived from
                those same pirates, or from others who did not respect the dangers
                of an asteroid field, and attempt retrieval accordingly.
                Navigating an Asteroid Cluster follows the rules for Asteroid
                Fields on pages 226–227 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook.
                Smaller fields of asteroids are often formed by the collision of
                large bodies, or the degraded wreckage of truly ancient vessels,
                but these pockets are not considered System Elements. Asteroid
                Clusters generate 1d5 Mineral Resources (see page 27)."

  description: "Some systems are wrapped in a vast ring of debris, formed

                the circling fragments together have since yielded to outside
                forces, but the inescapable draw of the local star maintains the
                remaining cohesion. The encircling line of an Asteroid Belt
                can cause difficulties to ships seeking passage deeper into the
                system. Any direct route requires successful navigation of the
                ring, although it is possible to bypass an Asteroid Belt by
                leaving the orbital plane of the system. Such detours tend to
                be lengthy, often adding several full days of travel.

  description: "The remains of orbital habitats, system defence stations, and deep
                space monitoring outposts can be found drifting through many
                systems. Even those that have never developed life of their own
                might house the relics of past explorers and would-be colonists.
                In systems with an active void-faring civilisation, such stations
                tend to be either relics of a surpassed level of technology, or
                a barely intact shell, abandoned to rising construction costs or
                disastrous systems failure. Whatever their origin, even the gutted
                remnants of a space station could contain valuable technology, or
                useful records on those who constructed it.

                If there is an active civilisation of the appropriate
                Development level in the System, then the Derelict Station
                most likely belongs to them. If the System is devoid of past or
                present life, roll on Table 1–4: Derelict Station Origins to
                determine its creators and original purpose and then generate
                1d5–1 (to a minimum of 0) Archeotech Cache or Xenos Ruins
                Resources aboard the station (see page 27). If the Station is
                fired upon in ship combat or suffers collateral damage from
                some other source, treat it as having 10 Armour, between
                4d10 points of Hull Integrity, and no other defences. For the
                purposes of any Endeavours to extract the Resources aboard a
                Derelict Station, it can be treated as a Derelict Vessel Encounter
                Site (see pages 59–60). At the Game Master’s discretion,
                the Explorers might be required to board the lonely station
                themselves to locate these resources, walking through the
                shadowy halls as voracious eyes gleam from the darkness."

  description: "The remains of old naval engagements and lost expeditions
                can be found drifting through the systems that the longago
                admirals and explorers once in charge of these ruined
                flotillas had sought to claim. The remains of an invasion
                fleet pounded to scrap by the system’s defenders could circle
                the system’s rim, or a collection of scout ships might hover
                just beyond the orbit of a planet where they could have
                replenished their failing supplies. More often, determining
                the origin of the vessels involved is impossible, after centuries
                of degradation and the attention of passing scavengers have
                long since stripped away anything recognisable from their
                hulls. Still, taking time to search the wreckage of a Starship
                Graveyard proves profitable as often as not. Supplies such
                as fuel, spare plating, or conduits can be found intact with
                some frequency, and some hulks contain full cargo holds, or
                even intact Ship Components of great worth.

                A Starship Graveyard can consist of anywhere from three
                to twenty or more vessels, although most of them are far
                beyond any attempts at salvage. The origin of these ships
                is only rarely consistent with any star-faring inhabitation
                a System might have. A successful defence would allow
                them full salvage of any losses, and an intact civilisation
                usually means there have been no unsuccessful defences. To
                determine the make-up of the fleet (or fleets) involved, roll
                on Table 1–5: Starship Graveyard Origins.

                The nature of the race or races that produced the ships
                is left to the GM’s discretion. Game Masters can use
                the ships from pages 194–196 of ROGUE TRADER Core
                Rulebook, which usually indicates a fleet of human (but
                not necessarily Imperial) construction, or, if they have
                access to volumes such as BATTLEFLEET KORONUS, they
                can find sundry strange and deadly xenos ships there. A
                Starship Graveyard contains 1d10+2 Archeotech Cache or
                Xenos Ruins Resources, each of which has an Abundance
                of 25+2d10 (see page 27). There might even be a mix
                of Archeotech Cache and Xenos Ruins Resources, if this
                stellar grave site is an ancient battlefield where multiple
                species met in cataclysmic conflict.

                Any individual vessel or conglomeration of ships can be
                treated as a Derelict Vessel Encounter Site (see pages 59–60),
                should the Explorers choose to board it."

  description: "The forces radiating out from the inner furnace of a star
                consist of far more than heat and illumination. The roiling
                fires of a star are far beyond the mightiest earthly blaze,
                and cast out through the system what some among the
                Adeptus Mechanicus call “the Light Invisible.” According to
                the doctrines of the Priesthood of Mars, visible light is but
                a small part of a spectrum of different energies. The auger
                arrays of voidships rely in large part on these forces, and are
                often overwhelmed by an excess of input when travelling
                close to particularly active stars. Though Rogue Traders are
                not generally inclined to the techno-theological theories that
                explain these matters, those who go through the harrowing
                experience of guiding a vessel blinded by bursts of stellar
                radiation often pay a great deal more respect and attention to
                the counsel of their Enginseers afterwards.

                Unlike most System Elements, Radiation Bursts do not
                represent an actual presence within the System. Instead, they
                exert an influence over the Solar Zone in which they are
                present (almost invariably the Inner Cauldron). The Detection
                bonus of any ship in the affected area is halved, as constant
                low-grade interference degrades any readings gathered. In
                addition, activity within an affected star can result in a surge
                of radiation throughout the Solar Zone. Such surges tend to
                be infrequent, spaced over periods of weeks, months, or more,
                but can occur as often as every 1d5 days after a sufficient
                build-up. Spotting the fluctuations that precede a radiation
                surge requires an Ordinary (+10) Scrutiny+Detection
                Test. Avoiding the effects requires leaving the affected Solar
                Zone, sheltering behind a nearby Planet or Gas Giant, or by
                temporarily insulating the ship’s augers with a Hard (–20)
                Tech–Use Test. Any ship caught unprotected within the area
                of effect suffers the effects of a Sensors Damaged critical result
                from page 222 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook, and
                additionally, cannot send or receive vox transmissions.
                This Damage cannot be repaired until at least
                1d5 hours after the surge, due to the lingering
                presence of these ravaging energies.

                A Solar Zone generated with multiple instances of
                Radiation Bursts further degrades the efficiency of augers
                within the affected area. The Detection bonus of affected
                ships is reduced by 5 per additional instance of the System
                Element after being halved."

                the treasures of the Inner Cauldron can make a cautious captain
                rich, but it can utterly destroy the greedy and reckless. Many stars
                seethe with volatile energies that erupt forth with little notice,
                and consume whatever is caught in their cataclysmic path.

                Unlike most System Elements, Solar Flares do not represent an
                actual presence within the System. Instead, they exert an influence
                over the Solar Zone in which they are present (almost invariably
                the Inner Cauldron). Each day a ship remains in this area, roll
                1d10; on a result of 10 or higher, the ship is caught in the effects
                of a Solar Flare, unless it can find shelter in a safe orbit behind
                a sheltering object. Treat the effects of a Solar Flare as inflicting
                1d5 hits from a Macrobattery with a Damage of 1d10+3. This
                Damage is stopped by Void Shields. Further, the effects of the flare
                are spread across such a vast area that it does not inflict Critical
                Hits like a weapon with a Crit Rating. Damage past the Armour
                of a Crippled ship still inflicts Critical Hits normally.

                A Solar Zone generated with multiple instances of Solar
                Flares is plagued with more frequent and widespread outbursts.
                For each instance of this System Element, add +1 to the 1d10
                roll for determining if there is a Solar Flare that day."
