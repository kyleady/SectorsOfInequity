  description: "The remains of old naval engagements and lost expeditions
                can be found drifting through the systems that the longago
                admirals and explorers once in charge of these ruined
                flotillas had sought to claim. The remains of an invasion
                fleet pounded to scrap by the system’s defenders could circle
                the system’s rim, or a collection of scout ships might hover
                just beyond the orbit of a planet where they could have
                replenished their failing supplies. More often, determining
                the origin of the vessels involved is impossible, after centuries
                of degradation and the attention of passing scavengers have
                long since stripped away anything recognisable from their
                hulls. Still, taking time to search the wreckage of a Starship
                Graveyard proves profitable as often as not. Supplies such
                as fuel, spare plating, or conduits can be found intact with
                some frequency, and some hulks contain full cargo holds, or
                even intact Ship Components of great worth.

                A Starship Graveyard can consist of anywhere from three
                to twenty or more vessels, although most of them are far
                beyond any attempts at salvage. The origin of these ships
                is only rarely consistent with any star-faring inhabitation
                a System might have. A successful defence would allow
                them full salvage of any losses, and an intact civilisation
                usually means there have been no unsuccessful defences. To
                determine the make-up of the fleet (or fleets) involved, roll
                on Table 1–5: Starship Graveyard Origins.

                The nature of the race or races that produced the ships
                is left to the GM’s discretion. Game Masters can use
                the ships from pages 194–196 of ROGUE TRADER Core
                Rulebook, which usually indicates a fleet of human (but
                not necessarily Imperial) construction, or, if they have
                access to volumes such as BATTLEFLEET KORONUS, they
                can find sundry strange and deadly xenos ships there. A
                Starship Graveyard contains 1d10+2 Archeotech Cache or
                Xenos Ruins Resources, each of which has an Abundance
                of 25+2d10 (see page 27). There might even be a mix
                of Archeotech Cache and Xenos Ruins Resources, if this
                stellar grave site is an ancient battlefield where multiple
                species met in cataclysmic conflict.

                Any individual vessel or conglomeration of ships can be
                treated as a Derelict Vessel Encounter Site (see pages 59–60),
                should the Explorers choose to board it."
