                      technology was at its zenith, these items are remarkable for
                      their craftsmanship, precision, and effectiveness. Archeotech
                      weapons and armour exceed even the finest craftsmanship of
                      the 41st Millennium.

                      Unfortunately, because of their
                      venerable designs and the long-lost secrets used to create
                      them, repairing Archeotech treasures (should they become
                      damaged) requires the would-be tinkerer to succeed at a
                      Challenging (+0) Forbidden Lore (Archeotech) Test
                      before he can even make an attempt to repair it."

        description: "Crafted by xenos hands (or claws, as the case may be),
                      alien technology is viewed with suspicion by most within
                      the Imperium. At the fringes of the galaxy, there is less
                      reticence to use the tools of xenos, though a Rogue Trader
                      would be wise not to flaunt any objects of alien origin he
                      may possess while in “civilised” company.

                      Because of its alien origins, xenos technology requires
                      anyone who wishes to repair it (should it become damaged)
                      to succeed at a Challenging (+0) Forbidden Lore (Xenos)
                      Test before he can attempt to repair it."

                      Whether crafted by human or xenos artisans, these
                      treasures are undoubtedly of surpassing quality, but they
                      nonetheless all evoke some sort of dread, from obvious
                      signs of Warp taint, to strange, glowing xenos crystals that
                      are almost hypnotic, to dark whispers in the mind of the
                      wielder."
