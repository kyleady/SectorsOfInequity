        description: "Some systems are wrapped in a vast ring of debris, formed
                      from shattered or stillborn planets. Whatever bonds once held
                      the circling fragments together have since yielded to outside
                      forces, but the inescapable draw of the local star maintains the
                      remaining cohesion. The encircling line of an Asteroid Belt
                      can cause difficulties to ships seeking passage deeper into the
                      system. Any direct route requires successful navigation of the
                      ring, although it is possible to bypass an Asteroid Belt by
                      leaving the orbital plane of the system. Such detours tend to
                      be lengthy, often adding several full days of travel.
                      Navigating an Asteroid Belt follows the rules for Asteroid
                      Fields on pages 226â€“227 of the ROGUE TRADER Core
                      Rulebook, although its diffusion across the System means
                      that successfully passing through requires only an Easy (+20)
                      Pilot (Space Craft)+Manoeuvrability Test. Asteroid Belts
                      generate 1d5 Mineral Resources (see page 27)."
