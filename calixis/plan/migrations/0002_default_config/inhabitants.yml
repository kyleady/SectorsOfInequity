  description: "While the ancient, star-spanning empire of the Eldar is said to have
                held countless worlds at its height, that era has long since passed.
                Since the fall of that ancient race, they have maintained few of
                their former holdings. The majority of the Eldar population exists
                on the tremendous vessels known as craftworlds, and set foot
                on a planetary body only rarely. Some xenographers devoted to
                the study of the Eldar believe that a large population could also
                be found dwelling in their legendary webway, perhaps even
                as a remnant of the original, vast empire. Rogue Traders
                consider such speculation as irrelevant as it is unlikely,
                as these supposed webway-dwellers show even
                less inclination towards the upkeep of planetary
                outposts than the craftworlders.

                In most cases, an Eldar-held planet is the home of an
                Exodite population, or a hub of operations for a corsair fleet.
                In rare instances, the Eldar presence is limited to unmanned
                sentry stations, to detect the approach of potential intruders.
                Experienced Rogue Traders treat all such claims as equal in
                their potential danger, as Eldar holdings are inevitably laced
                with hidden webway gates, from which reinforcements tend
                to pour out whenever it is least expected. Attempts to infringe
                on territory known to belong to the Eldar are usually limited
                to Rogue Traders with access to incredible firepower, a
                cunning smash-and-grab plan, or a dangerously large ego.

                The terraforming processes used by the ancient Eldar are
                legendary, with even incomplete efforts being responsible for
                many of the most wondrous paradise worlds known to the
                Imperium. At the GM’s discretion, any given habitable world
                held by the Eldar is the result of these processes. The world’s
                Habitability becomes Verdant, if it was not at that level already.
                Increase the Abundance of all Organic Compound Resources
                by 2d10 (see page 30). These “Maiden Worlds” are highly
                prized by their makers, and seizing one is likely to place the
                Explorers under hostile scrutiny. When the Explorers launch
                an Endeavour involving a Maiden World, roll 1d10; on a roll
                of 7 or higher, it immediately triggers a Misfortune, as the
                Eldar take retributive action. Given the prophetic abilities of
                the Eldar Farseers, the Misfortune might occur well before
                the Explorers even reach the Maiden World itself.

                The Eldar do not suffer intrusion lightly. The mere presence
                of a non-Eldar vessel exploring the areas they have claimed
                as their own triggers swift and brutal retribution. In other
                cases, the response is be more limited, or does not come at
                all. The Eldar are a dying race, and their more temperate
                commanders measure every encroachment’s threat against
                the potential loss of life that could be incurred resisting it.
                When circumstances are against them, the Eldar have been
                known to entirely abandon claims to their worlds for a time,
                trusting that the advantages granted to them by the webway
                and their Farseers can allow them to reclaim what is theirs,
                at a more opportune time.

                In the scope of a typical ROGUE TRADER game, this allows
                for a great deal of freedom in the GM’s representation of the
                Eldar’s threat. The GM can reward Explorers adept in stacking
                the deck in their favour with an easier claim to Planets wrested
                from the Eldar, as the Farseers find striking at such a potent
                foe inadvisable. Similarly, no GM should consider it necessary
                to punish his players for a boldly executed Endeavour against
                the Eldar, as their interests are far-ranging, and revenge can
                easily wait a generation (or five).

                Explorers who treat the claims and holdings of the Eldar
                with sufficient respect (or at least a sufficiently wide berth)
                are unlikely to incur the wrath of the ancient race. Such
                deference is not a sure defence, and GMs should not be shy
                to remind their players why the Eldar have a reputation for
                being capricious and unpredictable. On the other hand, the
                Eldar have a history of using other races as cat’s-paws and
                tools where their own strength is insufficient, and such
                Explorers might find themselves under consideration
                as a potential asset. In some cases, the Eldar claim
                to seek an alliances or pacts with the individuals
                such as Rogue Traders, and are thus more
                circumspect in their approach."

                            Certain proscribed texts describe their lifestyle as an act of
                            self-denial against the excess that brought low the empire of
                            their ancestors. Foolhardy war efforts have been launched by
                            those who thought the Eldar harmless without access to their
                            advanced weaponry, only to learn that the Exodites make some
                            exceptions to their prohibitions when threatened with war.

                            These worlds often maintain stockpiles of the potent
                            personal weaponry for which their race is feared, though
                            Exodite tribes replace the grav-tanks soaring through the
                            lines of their cousins with exotic cavaliers, riding xenos
                            beasts known only as “dragons.” When encroached upon by
                            hostile forces, the sudden transformation of the apparently
                            primitive nomads into an organised and ruthless army
                            makes it apparent that they struggle against the elements
                            and natural forces entirely by choice.

                            The Imperium’s limited understanding of Eldar politics
                            indicates that the Exodites are considered a separate nation
                            from their craftworld kin, which has invariably been backed
                            by assertions made during the limited instances of peaceful
                            contact with either faction. Many Lord-Generals, Rogue
                            Traders, and operatives of the Ordo Xenos have concluded
                            that this is a fiction, maintained by the envoys of the Eldar for
                            their advantage, after a seemingly successful operation against
                            Exodites was suddenly reversed by the arrival of an army sent
                            from the craftworlds. Careful observation of available data by
                            those with the clearance to obtain such things indicates that
                            the truth is neither wholly one thing nor the other, a situation
                            all too common when dealing with these enigmatic xenos."

              description: "It is more common to find evidence of Eldar interests on
                            a world than it is to find an actual Eldar presence. Various
                            worlds throughout the Expanse are circled by small orbital
                            structures of Eldar make, and no readily apparent purpose.
                            A study of these worlds shows no obvious commonalities, as
                            the known examples range from paradise worlds to barelystable
                            volcanic rocks. The only linking factor is found once
                            another race attempts to make use of the planet for their own
                            interests, at which point these interests become the target of
                            all manner of Eldar attacks. In one example of particular note,
                            the grand fleet of War Trader Noemi Odette was reduced
                            from dozens of vessels to a single crippled frigate, by an
                            attack from massed Eldar dragonships.

                            Most such attacks are nowhere near as extreme as this
                            terrible display, and some dynasties have found that attacks
                            on their holdings simply cease after they prove able to
                            weather them. It could be that the limited resources of the
                            Eldar are withdrawn from such apparently futile efforts, or
                            that the planets vary in their importance to their keepers.
                            Rogue Traders willing to gamble on these theories have
                            made great profits, but just as many have been utterly
                            destroyed for their presumption."

                            extremely rare, and such efforts are almost exclusively in
                            the hands of Exodites. The armies of the craftworlds are too
                            thinly spread for any sort of permanent garrison, and the
                            elusive Rangers never stay in one place for long. The corsair
                            fleets maintain the few permanent settlements among the
                            voidfaring Eldar, if their secret havens can properly be called
                            settlements. Most of these bases are hidden in the depths of
                            nebulae, or even the distant reaches of interstellar space, but
                            they can occasionally be found brazenly orbiting a planet
                            that the corsairs consider their own.

                            Such bases are typically found where they provide some
                            manner of advantage to the corsairs in question. Many fleets
                            take care to protect significant ruins and artefacts on worlds
                            their kind once held, and find a permanent base useful in this
                            vigil. At other times, a world provides something of value to the
                            claimants, some useful resource, or intriguing beast. Thuirafel
                            the Joyful, Pirate Prince of the Laughing Ghost corsair fleet, is
                            said to have maintained a stranglehold over the priceless arccrystals
                            of Insuemnamon Primaris for no other reason than to
                            deny them to a Rogue Trader who had slighted him.

                            Planets held by Eldar Voidfarers are not subject to the
                            normal reduction in their Resources. The Resources typically
                            remain completely untouched, although, the GM’s discretion,
                            the Abundance of Vivid Accessories is reduced by 1d5."

  description: "The remnants of colonisation efforts by the earliest human
                voidfarers can be found throughout the whole of the
                galaxy. Such lost civilisations are typically isolated and
                regressive, with no awareness of their ancient heritage, or
                of the glorious Imperium of Man to which they owe an
                inherent fealty. Other worlds, in contrast, have held onto
                more of their old glories, and have powerful technology
                and active voidships with which they fiercely defend their
                own. In either case, it is the sacred duty of a Rogue Trader
                to bring these worlds into the Imperium’s fold, and to purge
                any deviant elements of their populations that have grown
                powerful in a society unaware of the threats of the mutant
                and the psyker. This duty can sometimes condemn a world
                to death, if the chaplains and missionaries in service to the
                Rogue Trader find their beliefs irredeemably corrupt.

                All human civilisations are descended from the same
                technological basis. Those colonies not established during the
                heights of the Dark Age of Technology and the spread of the
                Standard Template Construct system are still descended from
                further expansion by those that were. Although no worlds
                have been known to maintain even a fraction of the technical
                knowledge from this common foundation, it has created a
                relatively stable basis for comparing the degree to which they
                have fallen. Human civilisations can exist at any Development
                level, and use the guidelines as presented.

                It should be noted that even civilisations of Voidfarer
                Development cannot equal the Imperium in the scope of
                the technologies to which they have access. Even the most
                advanced Imperial forge worlds are dependent on support
                and expertise from other worlds, and it is this network of
                infrastructure that provides the Imperium’s greatest assets. As
                a general rule, a randomly generated Planet can never have
                Navigators, sanctioned psykers, Titans, or voidships larger
                than Cruiser class, and only rarely has Warp-capable vessels of
                any kind. Of course, the GM can always make exceptions to
                these restrictions if he considers it appropriate for the Planet
                in question, but should be aware that such a Planet is likely
                to draw attention from interested parties across the Koronus
                Expanse, the Calixis Sector, and beyond.

                The overall structure of human civilisations on new worlds
                usually follows certain basic patterns. Of course, the
                combination of local conditions, the meandering course
                of history, and simple random chance sometimes cause a
                specific deviation from those patterns. For various reasons,
                societies are sometimes found with a handful of technologies
                remaining from their earlier days that far exceed their modern
                capabilities to produce. Maintenance on these wonders is as
                much a product of guesswork and luck as rote remembrance.
                Human civilisations at the Basic Industry or Pre-Industrial
                Development levels can, at the GM’s discretion, still
                have some form of advanced technology integrated
                into the fabric of their society. In most cases, a
                single, narrow category of device remains,
                such as a grav-rail network, a vox station
                and a handful of receivers, used for propaganda displays, or
                a small stash of lasguns, whose charge packs have not seen
                a proper outlet in centuries. Sometimes one or two related
                technologies have survived as well, although these are
                typically in worse repair than the first.

                There is no upper limit to the sophistication of technologies
                that survive in this manner, although certain specific
                categories of devices might prove impossible to maintain.
                No landbound populace can maintain a functional voidship,
                for example. Still, tales circulate the Expanse of the clubwielding
                primitives who nearly brought down an orbiting
                cruiser with a powerful defence laser, or of the Heretics of
                the Voice found on Ghorven VI, who worshipped a powerful
                vox-receiver, and believed centuries-old transmissions to be
                the commandments of their god.

                Without the blessed teachings of the Ecclesiarchy to guide
                them, the worlds held by Mankind often fall into the thrall of
                alien powers. While there is no level of folly at which it might
                seem practical (or even possible) to seek peace with such
                threats as an invading Ork Waaagh!, or the relentless savagery
                of the Rak’Gol, many have made errors no less deadly to
                the ultimate well-being of their populace. Entire worlds
                have been found in the thrall of openly-paraded Genestealer
                infestations, or paying tribute to Eldar raiders.
                Such behaviour is neither common nor typical, and
                is representative of a larger issue endemic to these lost
                worlds. A civilisation raised beyond the God-Emperor’s
                light frequently has difficulty understanding many of the
                strictures so patently obvious to Imperial citizens. Worlds
                that have had contact with seemingly benign xenos races
                often underestimate the threat posed by their neighbours.
                Even the blessed ignorance that comes with isolation can
                be harmful, as the natives assume that xenos beings cannot
                be any more foreign than the strangers from the stars, who
                come to tell them of this “Imperium of Man.”"

                            civilisation has transcended Basic Industry when its manufacturing
                            and production capabilities are theoretically able to provide for
                            the essential needs of the whole of its populace. Of course, few
                            civilisations actually meet the needs of all, instead allowing power
                            and resources to congregate around a few individuals.

                            Advanced manufacturing techniques often begin to emerge
                            at this level of development, including mass production lines,
                            and the synthesis of materials that cannot be found in nature.
                            Vox transmissions, advanced solid projectile arms and basic las

                            limits, as they are almost universally in possession of supplies
                            of highly advanced technology, possibly including powerful
                            generators, defence lasers, void shields, and even system ships.
                            However, this technology is never the product of the Colony
                            itself, and their industry is usually limited to maintenance of
                            the existing supplies, rather than any significant degree of
                            production and expansion. The defining limits of a Colony
                            are largely social, with a highly centralised populace, and ties
                            of dependence or allegiance to another world. Developing to
                            the point of self-sufficiency or independence transitions the

                            primarily defined by the technology of the populace, but by
                            their living conditions. Such populations do not dwell on the
                            surface of their planet, but in large stations, circling above it.
                            This is an especially common Development level for worlds
                            hostile to normal habitation, but various circumstances can
                            make the surface of a Planet unappealing or taboo to an
                            orbital populace, even if it is otherwise safe. In some cases,
                            the orbital stations simply lack the craft for re-entry.

                            Given the necessities of maintenance in the survival of
                            an orbital populace, the technical aptitude of such groups
                            tends to be both significant and widespread. The limits on
                            raw materials and production facilities imposed by their
                            circumstances do tend to limit the degree to which these skills
                            can be applied, however. In some cases, asteroid mining and
                            similar efforts can make an orbital population the equal of,
                            or even superior to their planetbound equivalents. If the local
                            civilisation is aware of potential threats from outside, their
                            habitats could have defensive capabilities, similar in scale
                            to the Wayfarer Station found on page 210 of the ROGUE
                            TRADER Core Rulebook, although the specific armaments
                            should be derived from their native technologies.

  description: "Though the Kroot seem to have been present in the Expanse for
                longer than even the earliest Rogue Traders, they have colonised
                few worlds throughout its stars. Most of the local Kroot populations
                stay aboard the massive, voidfaring Warspheres that carry them
                between systems, and it is rare for even a small warband to trade
                this nomadic lifestyle for a planetbound life.

                Sometimes a Warsphere passes a world with particularly
                promising genetic diversity, which inspires one or more
                Shapers to lead their Kindreds on expeditions to these worlds.
                These groups maintain contact with their fellows as best as
                they can, but give up their mobility in exchange for a chance
                to pursue unique new genetic advantages for their people.

                In general, Kroot populations tend to be isolationist. This
                species’ mercenary dealings make them disinterested in gaining
                enemies that might one day be potential employers, and their
                hunting lodges consider adding to their race’s strength a duty
                too important to interrupt for off-world concerns. Though they
                defend themselves against hostile interests, they do little to extend
                their sphere of influence, and treat any peaceful visitors from
                other species with polite indifference before firmly encouraging
                them to leave. Particularly successful or sophisticated colonies
                might entertain envoys from Rogue Traders and their ilk more
                enthusiastically, hoping to find a new crucible in which to test
                themselves and improve the strength of their Kindred.

                The exception to this relatively unbending rule is in their
                attitude towards Orks. It is rare for Kroot to turn down any
                opportunity to strike at their most reviled foes, or to partake of
                the Greenskins’ strength. A visitor to a Kroot lodge could likely
                hire many of the hunters who might be otherwise occupied if a
                conflict with Orks is brewing."

                            hunt and consume one the local fauna until the Shapers in
                            charge of the colony have mastered their gifts. This is a task
                            that can last for generations, and a number of Kroot hunting
                            lodges throughout the Expanse have been in continuous use
                            for centuries. Nevertheless, the Kindred who hold the colony
                            consider their tenancy and claim to be temporary, and look
                            at the idea of permanently settling a world with contempt.
                            Some Rogue Traders have thought this attitude to mean that
                            the Kroot would not defend their holdings, only to find their
                            armies added to the colony’s diet.

                            The goal of any Kroot presence on a world is to gain

                            planning or carefully selected hunts. Small groups of warriors,
                            hunters, and mercenaries from the larger Kindreds sometimes
                            become separated, and even large warbands can be stranded
                            when their Warsphere fails, or their employer abandons them
                            on a distant world. The ferocity and determination of these
                            stragglers can allow them to survive on almost any world,
                            but without the guidance of their Shapers, and the armouries
                            aboard their ships, the societies they form tend to resemble
                            nothing so much as feral hunting packs.

                            At the GMs discretion, a Kroot group that has been stranded in
                            this state for many generations might suffer penalties to Intelligence
                            and Fellowship, and even gain the Bestial Trait in extreme cases.
                            Most such penalties should be appropriately counterbalanced by
                            increased physical prowess, as the Kroot recklessly change their
                            nature beyond the bounds imposed by a Shaper.

                            If another Kindred finds them at this stage, they might
                            choose to hunt their fallen brethren to extinction or tame
                            them as beasts. They might even attempt to salvage some parts
                            of their genetic development in the hopes of using certain
                            new quirks without succumbing to the same fate. Some
                            xenographers theorise the Kroot Hound hunting beasts some

  description: "Rogue Traders investigating worlds all over the Expanse have
                had to deal with the encroachment of marauding Orks, to say
                nothing of those worlds already in their brutal hands. The mere
                presence of Orks in a nearby system would be enough of a threat
                to make many Rogue Traders reconsider developing a newly
                found planet, if it were not for the rarity of worlds outside the
                range of the Greenskin threat. In most cases, it is safe to assume
                that any nearby Orks probably do not have access to the ships
                necessary to threaten a dynasty’s holdings, and a Rogue Trader
                can take the absence of unruly Greenskin mobs crawling across
                every world in the system as evidence of this fact.

                In cases where an expedition is unfortunate enough to
                come into an Ork-held system without prior warning, most
                captains are inclined to promptly order their Navigators
                to reverse the course that took them there. On occasion,
                martially-minded or extremely bold captains have used their
                sudden arrival to strike at the Ork presence. Such battles
                rarely carry more reward than the satisfaction of vanquishing
                a thoroughly unpleasant threat. Still, Explorers who are both
                bold and fortunate might find that seizing the initiative in
                this manner allows them to claim a valuable world before the
                depredations of the infesting xenos stripped it bare.

                Habitable Planets held by Orks rarely remain so in more
                than the most technical sense. Territories held by Orks have
                a chance of being reduced to a Wasteland, instead of their
                normal type of Base Terrain. Former Mountain Ranges
                continue to assist with Navigation (Surface) Tests, but
                all such Territories generate Territory Traits based
                on their new designation. Such Territories
                likely show evidence of their former nature,
                such as the dried-out or befouled beds of marshes, or swathes
                of close-cut tree stumps. The Development of an Ork-held
                Planet determines the chance of a Territory to be changed in
                this manner, as described below.

                Orks invariably come into conflict with any other species they
                meet, although since this also true of any other Orks they meet,
                this does not generally result in a significant change on their end
                of the equation. Peace with Orks is quite literally impossible, as
                the species has no ability to grasp the concept. The best that most
                who encounter them can hope for is that the Orks are unable to
                notice or attack them, due to a lack of ships or surface-to-orbit
                ordnance. Such lucky cases often allow for the Orks’ numbers to
                be thinned quickly, but the tenacity and resourcefulness of the
                Greenskins often means a final clean-up must be done up close,
                where they cannot simply wait out the attack in a bolthole.

                In situations where it is impossible to surprise the Orks with a
                sudden orbital bombardment, it might still be possible to redirect
                their aggression. With sufficient inducement, most Freebooterz
                are willing to put off attacking a Rogue Trader for the time being.
                These efforts often involve outright bribery, though the Greenskins
                rarely show interest in any payment other than armaments and
                ammunition. Wiser Rogue Traders try to avoid paying off their
                would-be attackers with anything that can be turned against them
                when the Orks grow bored. Promises of more tempting targets
                can work even better than a direct payoff, especially if the new
                target promises both a good fight and valuable loot. Rumours
                persist that certain Traders in the Expanse seek out Freebooterz,
                to goad them into attacking their rivals’ interests. Such a strategy
                would be foolhardy in the extreme, but only a select few Rogue
                Traders are renowned for their caution."

              description: "A world claimed by a powerful Ork warband undergoes a
                            rapid and destructive scouring, as its resources are alternately
                            strip-mined for their value, or wantonly destroyed for the
                            amusement of a deranged warlord. If left unopposed, such a
                            warband can irrecoverably ruin a paradise world in under a
                            century. To encounter a world held in the thrall of the Orks’
                            savage “kultur” is to gaze upon a devastated wasteland, dotted
                            with a mix of ramshackle structures and shattered ruins, nearly
                            indistinguishable from the intact buildings. The one mercy of
                            such societies is the rarity of Ork Mekboyz who can build
                            voidships, and the lack of an attention span or organisational
                            structure to easily support such efforts when they do arise.

                            The wanton destruction and prodigious consumption
                            of what passes for Ork society places a tremendous drain
                            on the Resources of their Planets. Their Development
                            reduces all types of Resources, and tends to be especially
                            harsh on the sometimes delicate ecological balance
                            supporting Organic Compounds. They reduce the
                            Abundance of their Planet’s Resources by a minimum of
                            five steps, across all deposits. A thoroughly entrenched
                            and established population can reduce Resources
                            by as many as ten steps across all deposits, after first
                            reducing all Organic Compound Resources to a maximum
                            Abundance of Limited. If steps are not taken to reduce
                            or eliminate the Ork presence after it is encountered, the
                            GM should consider further reducing the initial Resource
                            Abundance, as time progresses in the game.

                            The treatment of Territories on Planets of this type is
                            appalling, and any that survive do so only because the Orks
                            have not yet developed an interest in them. When creating a
                            Territory on such a Planet, roll 1d10; on a result of 6 or higher,
                            the Territory has been reduced to Wasteland. Add a +1 to the
                            1d10 roll if there is an active Ork population in the region. If
                            the GM determines that the Orks have further degraded the
                            Planet over the course of a game of ROGUE TRADER, he can
                            freely convert any surviving Territories to Wastelands as time
                            progresses in the game. Additionally, reduce the Abundance
                            of all Resources on a Planet so inhabited by 2d10+5.

                            It should be noted that while most Ork clans technically

                            an uninhabitable Planet, such presences have never been
                            confirmed. This is partially due to the fact that few Mekboyz
                            would ever think of the idea, or bother attempting it, and
                            partially due to the tendency of the handful that do attempt
                            it to vent their comrades out the airlock for their amusement
                            shortly afterwards. The inevitable lack of continued
                            maintenance finishes off the few settlements that survive
                            this danger within a few months of the resident Mekboy
                            becoming distracted by a new project."

              description: "The concept of a true colony of Orks is widely considered a
                            fundamental impossibility, as the savages have no understanding
                            of concepts such as overpopulation, overconsumption, or
                            any sort of higher purpose. When viewed from another
                            perspective, it could also be said that Ork worlds consist of
                            nothing but colonies, as they have no known home world,
                            and indeed, no concept of “home.”

                            From this perspective, there is no practical difference between
                            the settlements that spring up around a crashed Rokk or the
                            planetbound wreck of an overconfident Brute Ram Ship, and the
                            sprawling factory-complexes and fortresses of the greatest Ork
                            strongholds. The first of these inevitably becomes the second, if
                            left to its own devices for a sufficient length of time. This school
                            of thought has led even the most self-serving Rogue Traders to
                            launch punitive and costly assaults on developing Ork worlds,
                            for fear of what they will eventually become.

                            As a result of all this, Ork worlds with the Colony
                            Development level have certain unusual and dubious
                            distinctions. The first is that such worlds have almost never
                            been home to an Ork presence for any significant length of
                            time, with the Orks’ arrival probably having occurred in what
                            would be recent memory, if Greenskins kept track of such
                            things. If they did not arrive through some arcane means,
                            such as teleportation or ejection from a space hulk, then
                            the remains of their vessel are likely to be a noticeable local
                            fixture. Explorers who encounter and ignore an Ork Colony
                            could well return find it has progressed in Development to
                            Advanced Industry a scant few years or decades later.

                            The other distinction of Ork Colonies is their unique
                            capability to defile a pristine world. Though the colonies
                            of other races are typically longer-standing and older than
                            a newly-erected Ork settlement, they lack the Greenskins’
                            capacity for wastefulness and ruin. An Ork Colony reduces the
                            Abundance of Organic Compound and Mineral deposits by 2d10+5.

                            This degradation can affect any kind of Resource. In addition,
                            roll 1d10; on a result of 6 or higher, the Territory nearest the
                            Orks’ centre of activity has been reduced to a Wasteland, and
                            a result of 9 or higher, the three nearest Territories have been
                            ravaged in this way by the presence of the Orks."

              description: "The presence of planet-bound Orks on worlds throughout
                            the Expanse is a phenomenon that is not fully understood. In
                            Imperial space, they are typically found as a recurring menace
                            on worlds that have successfully repelled a Greenskin assault or
                            invasion force. Their presence is believed to be due to leftover
                            Ork genetic material or spores from the earlier incident, a taint
                            which has proven all but impossible to fully remove. Sometimes,
                            worlds infested in this manner are found in the Expanse, with
                            the local societies stamping out the clans as they emerge as
                            best they can. What truly baffles the understanding of Rogue
                            Traders and Magos Xenosbiologis alike, is the presence of these
                            feral clans on worlds that could never have repelled an actual
                            Ork attack. Savage Greenskins have been found roaming across
                            planets that show no signs of having ever housed another
                            sentient race. Careful examination of captured specimens
                            and their limited technology shows no more than the typical
                            deviations from Orky norms, further complicating the issue.

                            The most common theory on the topic is that these Orks
                            are exiles or other outcasts, abandoned by their clans and
                            left behind as they travelled to new worlds. Detractors of the
                            theory scornfully suggest that its popularity derives from an
                            unwillingness to face unpleasant truths, and point out the lack
                            of corroborating evidence. Not only is the theory wishful
                            thinking, they say, but it flies in the face of actual observation
                            of Ork migrations. They point out that there is no recorded
                            instance of a known Ork stronghold weakening for any reason
                            but a direct attack, by rival Orks or by another race.

                            Still, if the popular theory seems unlikely, those put forth
                            by the opposition range from the similarly improbable to the
                            outright insane. The only rival school of thought to gain any
                            significant ground is based around observations by Magos
                            Severian, an Explorator in service to the Disciples of Thule.
                            Severian’s Postulate, as it is known, claims that Ork spores
                            can be found drifting through the void all across the galaxy,
                            and regularly fall upon almost every world. Most are burned
                            up in re-entry, and the remainder are rendered inert, due to
                            their isolation from further Ork presence. The examples in the
                            Expanse are often the result of spore clusters sufficiently dense
                            to survive planetfall in the numbers necessary to generate a
                            new Ork population. Those who have examined his arguments
                            and evidence have yet to find a flaw, but the implications are
                            disturbing enough that the Postulate does not spread far.

                            These Orks usually lack the technically-minded Mekboyz
                            that develop most Ork technology, but their primitive
                            Pigdok equivalents are still capable of exceeding the
                            commonly understood capabilities of their Development.
                            They sometimes have limited supplies of the more
                            common sorts of Ork weapons, including choppas and
                            sluggas. Some Pigdoks
                            have even mastered the
                            construction of crude
                            cybernetics, although they are as likely to apply them to
                            the quasi-tamed fighting beasts they keep as they are to an
                            actual Ork. These weapons and devices are primitive, even
                            by Ork standards, and their makers lack the skills to modify
                            them with a proper “kustom job.”

                            The low-tech societies of Orks are the least destructive of
                            their kind, although this is, of course, saying very little. This
                            degradation can affect any kind of Resource. Their migrations
                            are unlikely to deplete the lands around them as most Ork
                            inhabitation does, so these Orks only convert a given Territory
                            to a Wasteland on a 1d10 result of 10 when the GM creates
                            the Territory. Feral Orks reduce the Abundance of Organic Compound
                            deposits by 1d10+5."

                            Mekboyz are capable of incredible feats of insane engineering.
                            Orks with access to voidships tend to fall into one of two
                            categories. Of the first, the active and rampaging war machine
                            known as the “Waaagh!,” the Expanse remains largely and
                            mercifully free. Unfortunately, it is riddled with the fleets of
                            the piratical Freebooterz who comprise the second category.
                            The strongest of such fleets often make use of a planetary base.
                            Their reasons for doing so vary tremendously, with recorded
                            examples ranging from constructing vast armies of bizarre
                            cybernetic constructs to one Kaptin’s
                            legendary attempt to
                            carve a moon in the
                            shape of his face.

                            Although the firepower possessed by Freebooter Kaptins is
                            greater than that of any planetary warlord, the proliferation of
                            new targets opened up by void travel mean that these worlds are
                            often less devastated than might be expected from extensive Ork
                            habitation. Ork Voidfarers do not deplete their Planet’s Resources
                            any further than is typical for this level of Development, although
                            they consume all Resource types. The frequent urges of the Kaptins
                            to engage in acts such as carving insulting messages into a planet’s
                            crust with orbital weaponry does result in an astounding degree
                            of destruction in the local landscape, however. When creating a
                            Territory on a Planet held by Ork Voidfarers, roll 1d10; on a
                            result of 4 or higher, it has been depleted, and is a Wasteland
                            that automatically possesses the Ruined Territory Trait in addition
                            to any other results. Additionally, reduce the Abundance of all
                            Resources on a Planet so inhabited by 1d10+5."

                although stories conflict over whether this is the location of
                their profane home world, or simply the route they have taken
                from a more distant region. The few brave or insane souls
                who venture into the Depths to search for an answer never
                return, although pieces of them or their ships occasionally
                show up amidst the trophies recovered from Rak’Gol vessels.
                Most consider the idea of seeking the Rak’Gol home world
                with anything less than a full battlegroup of warships, or an
                Imperial crusade, to be the height of lunacy.

                Matters have grown considerably more complicated
                since reports started filtering into Port Wander of
                the xenos marauders claiming worlds beyond
                the boundaries of the Depths, for unknown
                reasons. It is unknown when such encounters first began occurring,
                as the rumours were not substantiated until the recent Battle of
                Holtsfall, in 801.M41, was fought in orbit of such a stronghold.
                The battle’s victor, Lord-Captain Patronius Holt, was forced to
                destroy the xenos structures with an orbital bombardment in
                order to claim the world for his dynasty, and the rubble left few
                clues as to their original purpose.

                Regardless of whether the Rak’Gol simply seek to
                expand their holdings, as would be expected of a less
                deranged species, or if they have some other unfathomable
                goal in mind, certain common factors have been found
                among all Rak’Gol habitations discovered to date. In most
                cases, the bulk of the xenos actually dwelled in orbit and
                reduced vast swathes of the planet to irradiated deserts
                for no discernible reason. In some cases, the Rak’Gol
                constructed their warrens and fortresses in the midst of
                the poisonous expanse they had created, while on other
                worlds, they avoided setting foot in any of these areas,
                even when driven back by assaulting troops.

                All Rak’Gol worlds are marked by special Territories known
                as Rad-Zones, even those that normally lack Territories of any
                kind. These Territories are considered to have the Desolate and
                Virulent Traits, although the ill effects of the latter trait are due
                to the high levels of radiation present, as opposed to toxins. The
                number of Rad-Zones present on a Rak’Gol Planet depends on
                its Development level. Rak’Gol Planets frequently house a fleet
                presence as well, with even minor encampments being defended
                by at least a single ship. Their more significant holdings often
                have a major battlegroup patrolling the reaches of the System.

                When the Rak’Gol come into contact with another species,
                only one side ever survives. No exceptions to this rule have
                been encountered anywhere in the Expanse, unless one counts
                conflicts as yet unresolved. As such, a System determined to have
                inhabitants on multiple Planets cannot have Rak’Gol Planets
                alongside the holdings of other species. Instead, Rak’Gol Planets
                are often found near Planets with Archeotech Cache or Xenos
                Ruins Resources, but these are usually of limited Abundance
                (1d10+5 or lower), given the extremely thorough destruction
                that the Rak’Gol visit on their enemies. Where Rak’Gol Planets
                at the Voidfarer Development level are concerned, the GM might
                consider applying these guidelines to nearby Systems, as well."

              description: "Newly-established Rak’Gol holdings have been found across
                            much of the Expanse. They are most commonly encountered in
                            the area between the God-Emperor’s Scourge and the Phaineal
                            Echoes, a region of space already plagued with significant
                            activity by their kind. Interestingly, these encampments often
                            seem temporary, as if set up as part of a grander effort.

                            The matter is further clouded by claims of Rak’Gol
                            holdings far from any known activity by their fleets. There are
                            a handful of verified reports regarding such activity, as far afield
                            as Winterscale’s Realm and the Foundling Worlds. Rak’Gol
                            planets have yet to be found near striking distance of Footfall
                            and the Maw, but many fear it is only a matter of time.

                            As far as can be told, establishment of a Rak’Gol Colony
                            always precedes a devastating barrage of nuclear fire, to create
                            one of their infamous Rad-Zones. The Colony’s main warren
                            is often, but not always, established in or near the Rad-Zone,
                            but its purpose remains unclear to outside observation. When
                            creating this feature, roll 1d10; on a result of 8 or higher,
                            there is a second Rad-Zone seared onto the Planet."

              description: "The Rak’Gol sometimes construct vast orbital stations, housing
                            a population similar to those found on their colonies. As far as
                            can be determined by the examination of reported encounters,
                            there is no comprehensible pattern determining which worlds
                            are occupied from the surface, and which from orbit. Issues of
                            atmosphere, potential foodstuffs, and resources, do not seem to play
                            into whatever alien priorities govern the decisions of the Rak’Gol
                            in this matter. A widely circulated but unverified tale even claims
                            that the xenos aboard an orbital station were once discovered in
                            the process of examining to their planet’s surface, only to turn the
                            station’s weaponry on the continent they occupied, reducing it to
                            rubble as soon as the observers were detected.

                            In all recorded encounters with Rak’Gol orbitals, their
                            stations were heavily armed and well-protected, with even
                            the most densely-populated habitats being the equivalent of
                            dedicated defence stations. They bristle with the infamous
                            Howler Cannons and Roarer Beams found on their warships,
                            although they usually lack torpedoes or launch bays. Imperial
                            strategists suggest that this could be due to the fact that the
                            xenos are known to construct variants designed exclusively
                            for raiding and slave-taking, rather than as actual weapons.

                            Though Rak’Gol in Orbital Habitation do not seem
                            to make significant use of the Planet they circle, they still
                            scar it with the Rad-Zones for which they are known. It
                            is believed that their stations are often constructed with a
                            weapon specifically designed for such work, although this
                            is impossible to verify, since no example has been captured
                            intact. These Planets typically have 1d5 Rad-Zones."

                            scattered and rare for the time being, but each is a unique
                            horror, surrounded by a fleet devoted to no other goal than
                            annihilation. As long as a single such stronghold of foulness
                            and depravity exists, it remains too many for the Imperium’s
                            comfort, and their numbers are far greater than that. Where
                            these worlds are known, they are denoted on every chart,
                            rutter, and navigational primer as an area of extreme peril,
                            but unfortunately, many more remain undocumented. Those
                            systems which their ships can easily reach are often subjected
                            to the same treatment, as an additional precaution.

                            The surface of these planets is often reduced to nothing but
                            a radioactive wasteland, broken only by cyclopean monoliths
                            and hideous fortresses, with walls like enormous knives or
                            fangs thrust forth from the earth. Innumerable minor Rad-
                            Zones mark the surface like a pox, and 2d5 larger examples
                            stand out like enormous scars. If doubles are rolled in the
                            generation of the larger Rad-Zones, then the number instead
                            represents those stretches of the surface not yet devastated
                            enough to be considered such a Territory, and the rest of the
                            Planet’s surface comprises a single enormous Rad-Zone.

                            Mercifully, the Rak’Gol have concentrated most of their
                            Planets at this Development level in or near the Alenic
                            Depths, and the majority of the remainder can be found in
                            the stretches of the Expanse known for Rak’Gol activity.
                            If a Rak’Gol Planet at this level of Development would be
                            found too far from the Alenic Depths or similar areas, the GM
                            should consider treating it as a Colony instead."

  description: "There are over a dozen known minor civilisations in the Expanse,
                populated by a variety of unique xenos, and many more are sure to
                be lurking on undiscovered worlds. The nature and scope of each
                race’s holdings varies tremendously, from the scavenger tribes of
                the Koeth Bone-Pickers, to the crystal cities orbiting worlds held
                by the Dominion of Fhjor. A given civilisation is likely to belong
                to a single Development level, with a handful of worlds varying
                slightly from the norm in the case of fledgling empires.

                There are no standardised rules by which new xenos races
                can be understood. Particularly zealous or militant Rogue
                Traders might prefer to deal with all such civilisations
                similarly, as the thunderous fire of macrobatteries remains
                a language that transcends any cultural, or even biological,
                distinctions. This approach is blunt, uncompromising,
                and yields predictable results, which means it is greatly
                favoured by Imperial traditionalists. Nevertheless, it
                can sometimes prove useful to negotiate with xenos
                powers, particularly those who can threaten an
                isolated ship, or who possess resources too
                valuable to risk ruining in conflict.

                Unfortunately, such negotiations are difficult in the extreme.
                A handful of the more expansionistic cultures have some
                knowledge of a language known to Imperial scholars, often
                through contact with nomadic races like the Stryxis. Some
                of these might be familiar with the common Low Gothic of
                the Imperium, although such knowledge is rarely widespread
                within a xenos culture. More commonly, exchanges are
                conducted in tongues not native to any speaker present, or in a
                broken pidgin, formed from half a dozen languages or more.

                The story of Emil Vendigroth is held up as a cautionary
                example of the dangers which this practice can present.
                According to the records of his ship’s First Officer, Vendigroth
                was negotiating safe passage with a xenos admiral, using the
                Eldar tongue. The Rogue Trader agreed to what he believed to
                be exceptionally favourable terms, only to find his counterpart
                rejecting his payment out of hand. When they met again, in
                an attempt to clear up the confusion, the shuttle holding both
                their delegations was incinerated by a pulsar lance from a
                passing Eldar corsair, who had intercepted their transmissions,
                and considered the entire exchange an insult to his language
                and culture. Vendigroth’s heir still avoids the region of space
                where his predecessor fell, fearing he might be called to uphold
                whatever bizarre bargain the xenos believe was struck.

                In the event that there is no common language on either
                side of the exchange, things can become considerably more
                difficult. Some Rogue Traders make use of highly trained
                lingua-savants or near-heretical cogitators to decipher
                new languages more quickly, usually allowing
                them to bridge this gap before tensions rise
                too greatly. It is rumoured that the legendary Solomon Haarlock
                trained himself to negotiate entirely in a series of easily understood
                gestures, and thus bypassed many language barriers entirely.

                The behaviours and common reactions of newly discovered
                xenos races are little easier to classify and categorise than any
                other aspect of their tremendous diversity. Aggression, fear, or
                some combination of the two are all common responses to the
                arrival of a Rogue Trader’s vessel in orbit above a primitive
                culture, but they are far from universal. Furthermore, as the
                power and knowledge of a xenos civilisation grows, it can
                become harder and harder to predict. Even the most advanced
                and powerful cultures have been known to react with fearful
                awe when they learn of the scope and grandeur of the Imperium
                represented by a Rogue Trader, while a lack of understanding
                can lead to fearlessness in facing down an army many times
                more powerful than the natives’ defence forces.

                GMs developing a new xenos culture for use in their games
                of ROGUE TRADER might find it useful to create a number of
                basic beliefs and attitudes, central to their mindset. Considering
                such details as dominant religions, previous off-world contact,
                and the nature of their home world, can give a rough idea of
                how the xenos would respond to the Explorers arriving, and
                help inform how willing they are communicate or compromise
                with outsiders. While it is possible to play this kind of situation
                by ear, these preparations usually allow for greater feelings of
                verisimilitude and consistency in the game, and can keep events
                moving, when unanticipated events demand a reaction."
