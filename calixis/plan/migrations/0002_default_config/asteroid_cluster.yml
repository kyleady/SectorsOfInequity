        description: "A full-bodied and cohesive Asteroid Cluster is usually formed
                      from the remains of a planet or moon that has undergone some
                      incredible cataclysm. The pieces are held together by what is left
                      of the planetoid’s gravitational field, although spread out over a
                      rather larger area of space. Pirates frequently use the obscuring
                      screen of an Asteroid Cluster to their advantage, and valuable
                      salvage can occasionally be found drifting amongst the rocks.
                      Wise captains are aware that such salvage is usually derived from
                      those same pirates, or from others who did not respect the dangers
                      of an asteroid field, and attempt retrieval accordingly.
                      Navigating an Asteroid Cluster follows the rules for Asteroid
                      Fields on pages 226–227 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook.
                      Smaller fields of asteroids are often formed by the collision of
                      large bodies, or the degraded wreckage of truly ancient vessels,
                      but these pockets are not considered System Elements. Asteroid
                      Clusters generate 1d5 Mineral Resources (see page 27)."
