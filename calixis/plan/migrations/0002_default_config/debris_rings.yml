        description: "A narrow band of asteroids or chunks of ice extends out around
                      the Gas Giant. While the limited spread means that avoiding the
                      field requires a detour, a vessel with cause to pass directly
                      through the ring must make a Challenging (+0) Pilot(Space Craft)
                      +Manoeuvrability Test as if passing through an Asteroid Field,
                      as described on pages 226–227 of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook.
                      Multiple instances of this Orbital Feature increase the size of
                      the rings. Tests to pass through safely suffer a –10 penalty for
                      each additional instance of this Orbital Feature."
