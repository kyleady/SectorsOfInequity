        description: "Unique opportunities can be found in harvesting the native
                      flora and fauna of a new world. Such creatures can often be
                      of value alive, used for study, bloodsport, labour, and other
                      purposes. For some species, their primary value is not found
                      in the complete specimen, but in a specific element of their
                      physiology or anatomy. The collection and processing of these
                      life forms can be of great value, although it sometimes requires
                      a more delicate approach than other sources of profit."

        description: "The restorative properties of certain species found in the
                      Expanse have made for a number of unlikely legends.
                      The application of herbs, fungi, and even the blood of
                      some creatures has saved the lives of numerous Explorers.
                      Relying on these treatments in a raw form is foolhardy,
                      as they often have a hidden cost, or only become viable
                      when the Curative is properly prepared in advance. Most
                      Rogue Traders prefer to sell such finds to those with the
                      knowledge to properly process them, such as the Magos
                      Biologis, the Orders Hospitaller, and exceptionally rich and
                      learned physicians in the service to noble houses.

                      Attempting to apply a Curative without taking the
                      proper steps to prepare it imposes a –40 penalty on
                      Medicae Tests. In such rushed cases, the effects of success
                      should be minor, (restoring 1d5 lost Wounds or removing
                      1 Critical Damage), and might even inflict Corruption or
                      Insanity Points in addition to the beneficial effects. The
                      process necessary to prepare a Curative for proper
                      application is up the GM, but generally requires
                      facilities not easily found in the Expanse."

                      unnatural properties. Such bizarre effects are not easily
                      understood, let alone categorised, but few Rogue Traders have
                      allowed such difficulties to impede their profits. Such curiosities
                      as bouquets of singing flowers, carved boxes of undying wood,
                      and exotic combat drugs, allowing incredible feats, have all
                      been found at the markets of Footfall and Port Wander.

                      Despite the successes, cautionary tales are also spread
                      of those whose ambition exceeded their wisdom. The
                      Rogue Trader Vivian DeMorza is said to have made a
                      philtre from local vegetation matching the effects of the
                      drug Polymorphine, which she intended to distribute to
                      her dynasty’s agents. If such a concoction existed, it might
                      have been a factor in her assassination, although all the
                      suspected parties in rival dynasties have strenuously denied
                      any knowledge or involvement. The truth of the matter was,
                      unfortunately, lost in the mysterious fire that spread across
                      her ship’s archives and holds, incinerating her records,
                      manifests, cargo, and even the securely stored Warrant of
                      Trade being sent to her successor."

        description: "A number of procedures and drugs exist throughout the
                      Imperium to extend life and youth, collectively referred to as
                      juvenat treatments. While many require arcane techniques and
                      devices provided at great cost by the Adeptus Mechanicus, others
                      involve injections, ointments, and elixirs derived from various
                      species across the galaxy. Such treatments vary in effectiveness,
                      and are sometimes limited in application if the subject builds up a
                      tolerance for the drug, but there have always been those who are
                      willing to pay fortunes for even a single additional year of life.

                      Juvenat Compounds must be processed in an appropriate
                      facility before use, and are usually toxic or otherwise
                      dangerous in their raw form. Fortunately, only a basic analysis
                      is necessary to identify the potential in the majority of raw
                      Juvenat Compounds. Facilities specialising in creating the
                      treatments are rare, with only a handful operating in the
                      entirety of the Calixis Sector. Suppliers are always welcomed
                      at such facilities, as well as at the less legitimate examples that
                      occasionally arise to supply the black market."

        description: "All manner of venoms and poisons are found with depressing
                      regularity across the Expanse, even in the rare environments
                      seemingly hospitable to human physiology. Although an apparent
                      adversity, this profusion of deadly toxins can be turned into a
                      valuable asset by Rogue Traders willing to deal in less savoury
                      markets. There are very few legitimate markets for poison, and
                      most are agencies which many Rogue Traders consider no less
                      hazardous than actual crime syndicates. Still, the profits that can
                      be made by selling a unique Toxin can be incredible, especially
                      while it remains unknown to those who could protect against it,
                      or develop antidotes. A tale that recently passed through Footfall’s
                      taverns claimed that an unknown Rogue Trader was given an
                      expensive Hive Primus estate on Scintilla in payment for a single
                      dose of poison unknown to the food-tasters, customs officials,
                      and physicians surrounding the intended target.

                      The source and nature of a given Toxin Resource is largely
                      left up to the GM, although it should not be more difficult to
                      find or extract than any other Resource of similar Abundance.
                      While a number of deadly venoms can be found by collecting
                      the venom sacs of elusive xenos beasts, a Toxin Resource is more
                      typically drawn from plant life, or creatures too slow to otherwise
                      deter predators. A character who is exposed to the effects of a
                      typical Toxin in its raw form must make a Challenging (+0)
                      Toughness Test or suffer 1d10 Wounds, ignoring Armour and
                      Toughness Bonus. The requirements for this exposure can vary,
                      although the most common vectors are injury or ingestion. Most
                      Toxins can be refined to increase the difficulty of the Toughness
                      Test or the amount of Damage the poison inflicts, and some
                      varieties are more or less dangerous in their base state."

                      patrons and show up their rivals. In recent centuries, it has
                      become a common practice to incorporate elements from
                      exotic beasts of the Koronus Expanse into such outfits. Some
                      fashions involve working horn, bone, or ivory into jewellery,
                      while others focus on particularly striking pelts and furs. Some
                      of the most expensive dyes used by the clothiers serving the
                      Calixian elite bear the colours of exotic alien blooms.

                      For a Rogue Trader interested in supplying this market, starting
                      a new fashion can be as simple as spotting an unusually coloured
                      creature or blossom. Some specialists cater to more demanding
                      clients by only collecting specimens as perilous as they are
                      impressive, but most buyers are satisfied simply to feel that they
                      have the allure of the distant Expanse at their beck and call."
