        description: "Clouds of gas, cosmic debris, and other minutiae drift through
                      many systems. They originate in a variety of waysâ€” some are
                      the remains of an asteroid field, long since battered into the
                      finest particles, and others contain the dissipating fury of an
                      erupting solar flare, dwindling to near oblivion before being
                      replenished by the next burst of plasma. These differences are
                      rarely considered in depth by Rogue Traders, who have no
                      use for them, except perhaps as concealment for their vessel.
                      Dust Clouds follow the rules for Nebulae on page 227
                      of the ROGUE TRADER Core Rulebook. Smaller dust clouds
                      often form on a temporary basis, but these are not considered
                      proper System Elements as generated by this System."
