        description: "It is said that during the Dark Age of Technology, Mankind
                      spread to every corner of the galaxy, no matter how remote. The
                      lonely ruins dotting many worlds across the Expanse bear mute
                      testament to the vast reach of these ancient human civilisations, as
                      well as to the terrible fall that took them from those heights. Many
                      worlds which were once home to far-flung colonies bear some
                      remnant of their pre-Imperial technology base, often providing a
                      source for artefacts coveted by the Adeptus Mechanicus.

                      Most such worlds are entirely devoid of devices matching
                      the common conceptions of archeotech, having suffered
                      the same slow degradation of their Standard Template
                      Construct-based manufacturing as the Imperium, and
                      some show no evidence of STC-standard technology
                      at all. Nonetheless, even the most degraded ruin
                      is held as a treasure by the archeosavants of
                      Mars, who pay generously for data from such
                      sites, and even more generously to gain access to them. Very
                      occasionally, relatively intact examples of advanced technology
                      can be found mixed in with the crumbled remnants.
                      Archeotech Caches virtually never represent a single, giant pile
                      of miraculous treasures from the Dark Age of Technology; instead,
                      this Resource generally means that the world is seeded with these
                      treasures, just waiting for enterprising Explorer to discover them."
