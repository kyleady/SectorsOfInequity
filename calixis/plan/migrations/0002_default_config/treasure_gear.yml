                      extraordinarily resilient—it takes minimal effort to maintain,
                      and takes a great deal of effort to damage or destroy."

                      that seems almost organic, and catches the light in eerie and
                      maddening ways. Regardless of its quality, one thing is clear:
                      no sane person would carry such a device, and those who do
                      have willingly taken the first steps on the road to madness.

                      Gear or Tool: This device is bizarre and inscrutable, made
                      for minds that now slumber beneath stars that have shifted
                      since they last lived. The user must make an Ordinary (+10)
                      Intelligence Test to use it. If he succeeds, he gains an
                      additional +10 bonus to any Tests to which it provides
                      bonuses. If he fails, however, he gains only its normal
                      bonuses, and also gains 1 Insanity Point as the
                      alien contraption stares back into his mind."
