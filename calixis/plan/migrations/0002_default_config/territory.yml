                      network of smaller canyons, or retain the imprint of whatever

                      extend through the crust of a planet, so that their roots are
                      filled with seething magma. Major canyon networks are often
                      used to assist mining operations in the surrounding area by

  description: "This Territory houses little in the way of life, and even less in
                activity. If its waters flow at all, it is not easily noticed, and
                the few creatures that live within are not easily found. It is
                a silent, still place, ill-suited to vigorous activity. Travellers
                become trapped in the mud, and even vehicles are fouled by
                it. Travel times through a Stagnant Territory are doubled, and
                Navigation (Surface) Tests are made at a –10 penalty."

  description: "In most cases, Territories are located where local conditions
                would be most likely to create the relevant base terrain. Forests
                are rarely found in frozen polar regions, and even the most
                experienced Explorers consider it unusual to find a Wasteland
                surrounded by verdant fields. For some reason, these general
                rules do not apply to this Territory, which exists where it is
                does not belong, and perhaps should not be."

  description: "The marshy pools here are not merely foul, but very nearly
                cauldrons of plague. The adaptations this spurs in the local
                wildlife make them just as bad, or worse. Simply spending a
                day in this Territory requires a Challenging (+0) Toughness
                Test to avoid suffering a Wound that ignores Toughness
                Bonus and Armour. Drinking the water without thorough
                treatment can inflict a variety of effects, from Toxic Damage,
                to months-long fevers, or even Insanity. All Rending Damage
                suffered within the Territory is treated as Toxic, due to the
                risk of infection. For the same reason, Medicae Tests to treat
                injuries suffered here are made at a –20 penalty."
