        description: "An asteroid of unusual size has been captured by the Planet’s
                      gravity well, and now occupies a stable orbit around it. It is
                      just large enough to be noted by an orbital survey, but not
                      enough to be seen from the Planet’s surface without visual
                      enhancement."
